 Parkinson's disease (PD) is now considered to be a multisystemic disorder consequent on multineuropeptide dysfunction including dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic systems. 
In Parkinson's disease, iron deposition within the substantia nigra is further increased, contributing to a heightened pro-oxidant environment in dopaminergic neurons. 
Combined with genetic factors that limit iron regulatory capacity and/or dopamine metabolism, this may increase the risk of Parkinson's diseases. 
We propose to (a) validate a retrospective biomarker of iron exposure in children; (b) translate this biomarker to adults; (c) integrate it with in vivo brain iron in Parkinson's disease; and (d) longitudinally examine the relationships between early-life iron exposure and metabolism, brain iron deposition and Parkinson's disease risk. 
This approach will provide empirical evidence to support therapeutically addressing brain iron deposition in Parkinson's diseases and produce a potential biomarker of Parkinson's disease risk in preclinical individuals.

cross-sectionally) consisting of clinical characteristics, neuroimaging, biospecimen and genetic information, then to develop criteria to assign patients to a Parkinson's disease subtype. 
Four hundred and twenty-one individuals with de novo early Parkinson's disease were included from this prospective longitudinal multicentre cohort. 
We then defined three distinct subtypes of Parkinson's disease patients: 223 patients were classified as 'mild motor-predominant' (defined as composite motor and all three non-motor scores below the 75th percentile), 52 as 'diffuse malignant' (composite motor score plus either ≥1/3 non-motor score >75th percentile, or all three non-motor scores >75th percentile) and 146 as 'intermediate'. 
On biomarkers, people with diffuse malignant Parkinson's disease had the lowest level of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β (329.0 ± 96.7 pg/ml, P = 0.006) and amyloid-β/total-tau ratio (8.2 ± 3.0, P = 0.032). 
Data from deformation-based magnetic resonance imaging morphometry demonstrated a Parkinson's disease-specific brain network had more atrophy in the diffuse malignant subtype, with the mild motor-predominant subtype having the least atrophy. 
Although disease duration at initial visit and follow-up time were similar between subtypes, patients with diffuse malignant Parkinson's disease progressed faster in overall prognosis (global composite outcome), with greater decline in cognition and in dopamine functional neuroimaging after an average of 2.7 years. 
In conclusion, we introduce new clinical criteria for subtyping Parkinson's disease based on a comprehensive list of clinical manifestations and biomarkers. 
Even though all participants had a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, patients with the diffuse malignant subtype already demonstrated a more profound dopaminergic deficit, increased atrophy in Parkinson's disease brain networks, a more Alzheimer's disease-like cerebrospinal fluid profile and faster progression of motor and cognitive deficits.

 The recurrent 22q11.2 deletion is a genetic risk factor for early-onset Parkinson's disease. 
We investigated clinical and neuroimaging features relevant to Parkinson's disease in 26 adults: 13 with 22q11.2DS at genetic risk of Parkinson's disease (mean age = 41.5 years, standard deviation = 9.7), 12 healthy age and sex-matched controls, and a 22q11.2DS patient with l-DOPA-responsive early-onset Parkinson's disease. 
The 22q11.2DS group without Parkinson's disease demonstrated significant motor and olfactory deficits relative to controls. 
The 22q11.2DS patient with Parkinson's disease showed the expected pattern of severely reduced striatal 11C-DTBZ binding.

 BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease can show premotor neurochemical changes in the dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic systems. 
Using PET, we assessed whether dopaminergic and serotonin transporter changes are similar in LRRK2 mutation carriers with Parkinson's disease and individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and whether LRRK2 mutation carriers without motor symptoms show PET changes. 
We included LRRK2 mutation carriers with or without manifest Parkinson's disease, people with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and age-matched healthy controls, all aged 18 years or older. 
People with Parkinson's disease were diagnosed by a neurologist with movement disorder training, in accordance with the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria. 
In the first study, LRRK2 mutation carriers with or without manifest Parkinson's disease who were referred for investigation between July, 1999, and January, 2012, were scanned with PET tracers for the membrane dopamine transporter, and dopamine synthesis and storage ((18)F-6-fluoro-L-dopa; (18)F-FDOPA). 
We compared findings with those in people with sporadic Parkinson's disease and age-matched healthy controls. 
In the second study, distinct groups of LRRK2 mutation carriers, individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and age-matched healthy controls seen from November, 2012, to May, 2016, were studied with tracers for the serotonin transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). 
FINDINGS: Between January, 1997, and January, 2012, we obtained data for our first study from 40 LRRK2 mutation carriers, 63 individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and 35 healthy controls. 
LRRK2 mutation carriers with manifest Parkinson's disease (n=15) had reduced striatal dopamine transporter binding and (18)F-FDOPA uptake, comparable with amounts seen in individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease of similar duration. 
LRRK2 mutation carriers without manifest Parkinson's disease (n=25) had greater (18)F-FDOPA uptake and dopamine transporter binding than did individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, with (18)F-FDOPA uptake comparable with controls and dopamine transporter binding lower than in controls. 
Between November, 2012, and May, 2016, we obtained data for our second study from 16 LRRK2 mutation carriers, 13 individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, and nine healthy controls. 
Nine LRRK2 mutation carriers without manifest Parkinson's disease had significantly elevated serotonin transporter binding in the hypothalamus (compared with controls, individuals with LRRK2 Parkinson's disease, and people with sporadic Parkinson's disease, p<0·0001), striatum (compared with people with sporadic Parkinson's disease, p=0·02), and brainstem (compared with LRRK2 mutation carriers with manifest Parkinson's disease, p=0·01), after adjustment for age. 
Striatal VMAT2 binding was reduced in all individuals with manifest Parkinson's disease and reduced asymmetrically in one LRRK2 mutation carrier without manifest disease. 
INTERPRETATION: Dopaminergic and serotonergic changes progress in a similar fashion in LRRK2 mutation carriers with manifest Parkinson's disease and individuals with sporadic Parkinson's disease, but LRRK2 mutation carriers without manifest Parkinson's disease show increased serotonin transporter binding in the striatum, brainstem, and hypothalamus, possibly reflecting compensatory changes in serotonergic innervation preceding the motor onset of Parkinson's disease. 
Increased serotonergic innervation might contribute to clinical differences in LRRK2 Parkinson's disease, including the emergence of non-motor symptoms and, potentially, differences in the long-term response to levodopa.

'stops walking while talking'), is a largely unexplained and frequent symptom of Parkinson's disease. 
Here we consider two circuit-level accounts of how striatal dopamine depletion might lead to impaired dual tasking in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Second, the known dorso-posterior to ventro-anterior gradient of dopamine depletion in patients with Parkinson's disease may cause a funnelling of motor and cognitive processes into the relatively spared ventro-anterior putamen, causing a neural bottleneck. 
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain activity in 19 patients with Parkinson's disease and 26 control subjects during performance of a motor task (auditory-cued ankle movements), a cognitive task (implementing a switch-stay rule), and both tasks simultaneously (dual task). 
These observations suggest that dual task impairments in Parkinson's disease are related to reduced spatial focusing of striatal activity.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of neuronal dopamine production in the brain. 
 Reduction of mitochondrial complex I activity is one of the major hypotheses for dopaminergic neuron death in Parkinson's disease. 
Here, we investigated the effect of reduced complex I activity on non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease using conditional knockout (cKO) mice in which Ndufs4 was selectively deleted in dopaminergic neurons (Ndufs4 cKO). 
Furthermore, even though motor behavior were not affected, Ndufs4 cKO mice showed non-motor symptoms experienced by many Parkinson's disease patients including impaired cognitive function and increased anxiety-like behavior. 
These data suggest that mitochondrial complex I dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons promotes non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and reduces dopamine content in the absence of dopamine neuron loss. 
 Through the course of over three decades, nonhuman primate (NHP) studies on cell-based therapies (CBTs) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have provided insight into the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the approach, methods of cell collection and preparation, cell viability, as well as potential brain targets.

Parkinson's disease -related neurodegeneration is likely to occur several decades before the onset of the motor symptoms. 
Parkinson's disease neuropathology is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, with widespread involvement of other central nervous system (CNS) structures and peripheral tissues. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the efficacy of L-dopa therapy depends on its ability to restore Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the striatum. 
Apomorphine has been described as a psychoactive alkaloid and is a non-selective dopamine agonist primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease as it stimulates dopamine receptors and improves motor function.

Thus, calbindin-positive and calbindin-negative SNc neurons differ substantially in their calcium channel composition and efficacy of excitatory inputs in the presence of dopamine inhibition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons can be divided into two populations: the calbindin-negative ventral tier, which is vulnerable to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, and the calbindin-positive dorsal tier, which is relatively resilient. 
 Psychotic subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) "on" dopaminergic drugs, especially on dopamine agonists, present a hyperdopaminergic state that interferes with learning processing. 
 Impairments in motor automaticity cause patients with Parkinson's disease to rely on attentional resources during gait, resulting in greater motor variability and a higher risk of falls.

A major breakthrough in treating brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease is to drive neuroplasticity in a direction to improve motor and cognitive dysfunction. 
We consider that the enhancement of motor recovery in both animal models of dopamine depletion and in patients with Parkinson's disease is optimized when cognitive circuits are engaged; in other words, the brain is engaged in a learning modality. 
Therefore, we propose that to be effective in treating Parkinson's disease, physical therapy must employ both skill-based exercise (to drive specific circuits) and aerobic exercise (to drive the expression of molecules required to strengthen synaptic connections) components to select those neuronal circuits, such as the corticostriatal pathway, necessary to restore proper motor and cognitive behaviors. 
In the wide spectrum of different forms of exercise, learning as the fundamental modality likely links interventions used to treat patients with Parkinson's disease and may be necessary to drive beneficial neuroplasticity resulting in symptomatic improvement and possible disease modification.

 INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which results in a significant decrease in dopamine levels and consequent functional motor impairment. 
The aim of our review is to analyse the most relevant studies worldwide addressing the benefits of some phytochemicals used in in vitro models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of aging characterized by motor symptoms that result from the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons and the disruption of dopamine-mediated neurotransmission. 
Typical neuropathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) include degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra that project to the striatum (nigro-striatal pathway) and depositions of cytoplasmic fibrillary inclusions (Lewy bodies) which contain ubiquitin and α-synuclein. 
 Exposure to early life stress has been shown to result in anxiety-like symptoms and exacerbates degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the progressive neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) which is responsible for disabling motor abnormalities in more than 6.5 million people worldwide. 
Recent evidence indicates that Cdk5 is inappropriately activated in several neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Motor dysfunction (e.g., bradykinesia) and motivational deficit (i.e., apathy) are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Applied to Parkinson's disease, this computational analysis revealed two independent effects of dopamine enhancers, which predicted clinical improvement in motor and motivational deficits. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been suggested to share personality traits characterised by low novelty-seeking and high harm-avoidance. 
Although its physiological function remains enigmatic, alpha-synuclein is implicated in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Dementia with Lewy bodies. 
 BACKGROUND: Misfolded α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates participate in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: A series of synthesized α-Syn peptides, corresponding to the locus in FL-α-Syn containing alanine 30, substitution of which with a proline causes a familial form of Parkinson's disease, were examined for their capacity of inducing release of microglial superoxide.

 l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) is the therapeutic gold standard in Parkinson's disease. 
 Impaired attentional flexibility is considered to be one of the core cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Dopamine replacement therapy by its precursor, L-3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), has been the treatment of choice for Parkinson's disease. 
However, the possible contributory effect of L-DOPA therapy on the progression of Parkinson's disease mediated by the L-DOPA-induced toxic metabolites remains elusive. 
One such metabolite is homocysteine, the level of which increases in the plasma of Parkinson's disease patients undergoing L-DOPA therapy, as well as in brain of animal models of the disease. 
Therefore, it can be propounded that elevated level of Hcy (hyperhomocysteinemia) is one of the underlying causes of L-DOPA-induced side-effects and aggravates the progressive nature of Parkinson's disease, which has been focused here. 
We have provided a conjectural discussion on the involvement of Hcy in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSION: Hyperhomocysteinemia as a result of prolonged L-DOPA therapy is the emerging cause of L-DOPA-induced behavioral abnormalities and progressive nature of Parkinson's disease.

The survival of DA neurons under neurotoxin challenge was examined in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) Parkinson's disease animal model and the more subtle function under challenge of the dopaminergic system was examined by methamphetamine single- and repeated challenge in wt and ko mice. 
In unilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesions modeling Parkinson's disease, using stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA intrastriatally led to loss of dopaminergic neurons in SN and diminished TH positive projections in striatum. 
 Inflammatory responses are involved in mechanisms of neuronal cell damage in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Mice with striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions are widely used as a model to study the effects of neurorestorative, symptomatic, or antidyskinetic treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD).

 SEE POSTUMA DOI101093/AWW131 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS ARTICLE: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging dysfunction within the basal ganglia network is a feature of early Parkinson's disease and may be a diagnostic biomarker of basal ganglia dysfunction. 
Currently, it is unclear whether these changes are present in so-called idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, a condition associated with a high rate of future conversion to Parkinson's disease. 
We compare these data to a set of healthy control subjects, and to a set of patients with established early Parkinson's disease. 
Twenty-six patients with polysomnographically-established rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 48 patients with Parkinson's disease and 23 healthy control subjects were included in this study. 
In addition, eight patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 10 with Parkinson's disease and 10 control subjects received (123)I-ioflupane single photon emission computerized tomography. 
We tested for reduction of basal ganglia network connectivity, and for loss of tracer uptake in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease relative to each other and to controls. 
Connectivity measures of basal ganglia network dysfunction differentiated both rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease from controls with high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (74% for rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 78% for Parkinson's disease), indicating its potential as an indicator of early basal ganglia dysfunction. 
Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder was indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging despite obvious differences on dopamine transported single photon emission computerized tomography. 
Basal ganglia connectivity is a promising biomarker for the detection of early basal ganglia network dysfunction, and may help to identify patients at risk of developing Parkinson's disease in the future. 
 SCOPE: The accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons is the leading cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an overwhelming neurodegenerative disorder caused by deterioration of a neurotransmitter, known as dopamine. 
 Functional neuroimaging for the dopamine transporter (DAT) is used to distinguish drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) from subclinical Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease where the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway leads to specific motor deficits. 
In mice, low VMAT2 levels causes catecholaminergic cell loss and behaviors resembling Parkinson's disease, while high levels of VMAT2 increase dopamine release and protect against dopaminergic toxicants. 
These results confirm the role of VMAT2 in the protection of vulnerable nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and may also provide new insight into the side effects of L-DOPA treatments in Parkinson's disease. 
These symptoms fit in with the recently published criteria of 'prodromal Parkinson's Disease' and prompted a formal assessment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 One of the intermediates of methionine cycle, the homocysteine (Hcy), elevates in plasma of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) therapy and has been regarded as a risk factor of the disease.

It is a bifunctional electrophile implicated in the loss of dopaminergic cells concomitant with Parkinson's disease and neurodegeneration. 
Therefore, depleted antioxidants and increased levels of lipid peroxidation products, known to prevent the detoxifying metabolism of DOPAL, may present a survival challenge to dopaminergic cells targeted in Parkinson's disease. 
 AIMS OF THE STUDY: To investigate whether significant midbrain atrophy is present in Parkinson's disease (PD), and if so, whether it can be used as a marker of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. 
 BACKGROUND: Impulse Control Disorder symptoms (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been recently associated by magnetic Resonance imaging with impaired cortico-striatal connectivity, especially between left putamen and frontal associative areas. 
Recently, AGE and its components have been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In recent years progress has been made in the detection and evaluation of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
RECENT FINDINGS: The most intriguing recent finding is the fact that Parkinson's disease may be a spreading disease. 
If this would be achieved premotor signs, such as hyposmia, rapid eye movement-sleep behavior disorder, constipation, or depression may be a kind of biomarkers which allow together with other diagnostic tools, such as parenchymal sonography, iodobenzamide-scintigraphy and dopamine transporter scans the prediction whether somebody might be under way to develop the full-blown Parkinson's disease syndrome. 
SUMMARY: Parkinson's disease seems to be a spreading disease which causes not only a dopaminergic deficit as major cause for the movement disorder but also impairs function of many other brain centers which leads to a multitransmitter malfunction. 
 α-Synuclein (αS) is the main protein component of Lewy bodies, characterizing the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We describe evidence supporting the hypothesis that α-synuclein has a prion-like role in Parkinson's disease and related α-synucleinopathies, and discuss how this novel thinking impacts the development of diagnostics and disease-modifying therapies. 
RECENT FINDINGS: Observations that immature dopamine neurons grafted to Parkinson's disease patients can develop Lewy bodies triggered a surge of interest in the putative prion-like properties of α-synuclein. 
Some of the genes were found to be related to neurological disease pathways, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. 
 Bradykinesia is the most disabling motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD).

 BACKGROUND: Although dopamine agonists (DAs) are useful in Parkinson's disease (PD), they are not frequently used in elderly patients due to adverse effects. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with oxidative stress and the death of melanin-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. 
Epidemiological evidence links exposure to the pesticide paraquat (PQ) to Parkinson's disease, and this link has been explained by a redox cycling mechanism that induces oxidative stress. 
This observation of PQ-melanin redox interactions demonstrates an association between two components that have been individually linked to oxidative stress and Parkinson's disease. 
Potentially, melanin's redox activity could be an important component in understanding the etiology of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
However, mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of chrysin has not been fully elucidated, and the effects of chrysin on the Parkinson's disease (PD) model in vivo have not been investigated. 
Because of its unique pharmacology, pimavanserin was approved for the treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease, and it has a low risk for exacerbating motor symptoms compared to standard antipsychotic medications.

 RATIONALE: Dopaminergic therapy improves some cognitive functions and worsens others in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between dopamine receptor DRD3 gene tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Several studies have suggested that the thalamic centromedian-parafascicular (CM/PF or the PF in rodents) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Impulse control disorders and compulsive medication intake may occur in a minority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is well known for motor deficits such as bradykinesia. 
 BACKGROUND: A pro-inflammatory gut microbiota was described in both Parkinson's disease and colorectal cancer (CRC) and recently α-synuclein was demonstrated in the enteric nervous system. 
We sought to evaluate the association between Parkinson's disease and CRC. 
The primary exposure of interest was diagnosis of Parkinson's disease prior to CRC as well as disease duration, and Parkinson's specific therapies. 
Past medical history of Parkinson's disease >1 year before index-date was associated with lower CRC risk (OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.59-0.94). 
CONCLUSION: Parkinson's disease is inversely associated with CRC risk. 
 OBJECTIVE A better understanding of the effects of chronically delivering compounds to the substantia nigra and nearby areas is important for the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat alpha-synucleinopathies, like Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS The data from this study support the feasibility of using a pump-and-catheter system for chronic intranigral infusion and lay the foundation for using this approach to treat Parkinson's disease or other related degenerative diseases that would benefit from targeted drug delivery to the substantia nigra or to other brainstem regions. 
 Increasing evidence suggests that the dopaminergic degeneration which characterizes Parkinson's disease starts in the striatal dopamine terminals and progresses retrogradely to the body of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra. 
by microgliosis), it may be suitable to study the role of striatal astrocytes during the dopaminergic denervation which characterizes the first stages of Parkinson's disease. 
 The characteristic slowness of movement in Parkinson's disease relates to an imbalance in the activity of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the direct (dMSNs) and indirect (iMSNs) pathways. 
Therefore, cortical drive to dMSNs decreases after partial nigrostriatal lesions producing no behavioral impairment, but additional alterations in the gain and timing of iMSNs characterize symptomatic rodent parkinsonism.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Prevailing models of Parkinson's disease state that motor symptoms arise from an imbalance in the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from the direct (dMSNs) and indirect (iMSNs) pathways. 
Using a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, we found that behaviorally undetectable nigrostriatal lesions induced a significant disconnection of dMSNs from the motor cortex. 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative dysfunction characterized by the loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system with a consequent dopamine decrease. 
Treatments for Parkinson's disease aim for improving these motor symptoms by increasing the dopaminergic signal in the striatum with levodopa in combination with enzyme inhibitors or anticholinergic drugs. 
 BACKGROUND: In recent years, some observational studies suggested that pramipexole, a non-ergot dopamine agonist (DA) used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), may increase the risk of heart failure (HF). 
The adamantane-based compounds presented in this manuscript have been approved for a wide spectrum of indications (antivirals, antidiabetics and against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease). 
 The catecholaldehyde hypothesis predicts that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition should slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, by decreasing production of the autotoxic dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). 
 Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are debilitating side effects of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in Parkinson's disease (PD) that severely affect the quality of life of patients. 
 Pramipexole and ropinirole are dopamine agonists that are efficacious in treating motor disturbances of neuropathologies, e.g., Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. 
Toward that objective, the current study implemented a rat model of Parkinson's disease to behaviorally profile chronically administered pramipexole. 
This was accomplished with male Sprague-Dawley rats wherein (i) 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the dorsolateral striatum produced Parkinson's disease-like akinesia, measured in the forelimbs, (ii) intracranial self-stimulation-mediated probability discounting indicated impulsivity/risk-taking, and (iii) two doses of pramipexole were continuously administered for 14-28days via osmotic minipumps to mirror the chronic, stable exposure achieved with extended release formulations. 
 Cell therapy has attracted considerable interest as a promising therapeutic alternative for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results provide further evidence for the clinical translation of hpNSC and support the approval of the world's first pluripotent stem cell based Phase I/IIa study for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Clinical Trial Identifier NCT02452723). 
 BACKGROUND As the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) principally impacts the motor system in approximately 7 million patients worldwide. 
 Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy is widely accepted as a beneficial tool for differentiating Parkinson's disease (PD) from other Parkinson-related disorders (PRD). 
 Estrogen attenuates the loss of dopamine neurons from the substantia nigra in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and excitatory amino-acid induced neurotoxicity by interactions with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and calretinin (CR) containing dopaminergic (DA) neurons. 
 AIMS: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease affecting the population. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, in which the nigro-striatal Dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons are selectively lost. 
 Bradykinesia is a prominent phenotype of Parkinson's disease, depression, and other neurological conditions. 
Here we show that selective deletion of DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) from indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) is sufficient to impair locomotor activity, phenocopying DA depletion models of Parkinson's disease, despite this mouse model having intact DA transmission. 
 A crucial event in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is the death of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system, which are responsible for the regulation of motor function. 
Therefore, the development of a technology for the diagnosing of Parkinson's disease at the preclinical stage is of a high priority in neurology. 
In this study, we have developed at an experimental model a fundamentally novel for neurology approach for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease at the preclinical stage. 
Thus, the above experimental data strongly suggest that αMpT-based challenge test might be considered as the provocation test for Parkinson's disease diagnosis at the preclinical stage in the future clinical trials. 
However, there are no reports on the role of LCN2 in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, LCN2 expression and its role in Parkinson's disease (PD) are largely unknown. 
These findings warrant further exploration of GPe as a target for interventions for Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often suffer from cognitive impairments, including set-shifting deficits, in addition to the characteristic motor symptoms. 
 Striatal dopamine deficiency is the core feature of the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD), and dopamine replacement with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) is the mainstay of PD treatment. 
Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
Extrapolation of post-mortem data predicts that a ∼30% decline of nigral dopamine neurons is necessary to cause motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
We investigated the utility of (18)F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography to visualize the concentration of nigral neuromelanin in Parkinson's disease and correlated the findings to dopamine transporter density, measured by (123)I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography. 
A total of 17 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 16 age- and sex-matched control subjects had (18)F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography using a Siemens high-resolution research tomograph. 
Twelve patients with Parkinson's disease also received a standardized (123)I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography scan at our imaging facility. 
Many of the patients with Parkinson's disease displayed visually apparent decreased (18)F-AV-1451 signal in the midbrain. 
 Adaptive behaviour entails the capacity to select actions as a function of their energy cost and expected value and the disruption of this faculty is now viewed as a possible cause of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Indirect evidence points to the involvement of the subthalamic nucleus-the most common target for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease-in cost-benefit computation. 
Here we tested these contrasting hypotheses by recording the neuronal activity of the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease during an effort-based decision task. 
Local field potentials were recorded from the subthalamic nucleus of 12 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (mean age 63.8 years ± 6.8; mean disease duration 9.4 years ± 2.5) both OFF and ON levodopa while they had to decide whether to engage in an effort task based on the level of effort required and the value of the reward promised in return. 
Our findings are consistent with the view that Parkinson's disease symptoms may be caused by a disruption of the processes involved in balancing the value of actions with their associated effort cost. 
 The treatment of early Parkinson's disease with dopaminergic agents remains the mainstay of symptomatic therapy for this incurable neurodegenerative disorder. 
Using clinical data and DNA samples ascertained through the largest placebo-controlled clinical trial of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, rasagiline (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00256204), we examined how polymorphisms in candidate genes associate with the clinical response to rasagiline in early Parkinson's disease. 
Variants in genes that express proteins involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rasagiline, and genes previously associated with the risk to develop Parkinson's disease were genotyped. 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2283265 and rs1076560, in the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) were found to be significantly associated with a favourable peak response to rasagiline at 12 weeks in early Parkinson's disease after controlling for multiple testing. 
This is the largest and most comprehensive pharmacogenetics study to date examining clinical response to an anti-parkinsonian drug and the first to be conducted in patients with early stage Parkinson's disease receiving monotherapy. 
Impairments in behavioural activation and effort-related aspects of motivation are associated with psychiatric symptoms such as anergia, fatigue, lassitude and psychomotor retardation, which cross multiple pathologies, including depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. 
People with major depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease show evidence of decision-making biases towards a lower exertion of effort. 
 BACKGROUND: The causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) are unknown in the majority of patients. 
 Dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) expressed on CD4(+) T cells is required to promote neuroinflammation in a murine model of Parkinson's disease. 
Predisposing factors for intoxication are advanced age, diet disturbances, comorbid medical conditions affecting heart, kidneys or central nervous system and polypharmacy.CASE REPORT: Here we present a case of a 74-year-old woman with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypertension and bipolar disorder. 
Dyskinesia, associated with dopamine super-sensitivity of striatal neurons, is a debilitating side effect of L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
Depression is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its pathophysiology is unclear.

The results showed that RXR ligands could increase neurotrophic signaling, but provided a mixed picture of its potential in a Parkinson's disease rat model in vivo. 
However, this study clearly emphasized Nurr1's neuroprotective role and indicated that other RXR ligands could have therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease. 
 Currently there is no neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
Here we report that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on astrocytes mediates endogenous production of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which prevents the active degeneration of dopamine neurons and leads to behavioural recovery through CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFRα) on nigral dopamine neurons in both the MPP(+)-lesioned or adeno-associated virus α-synuclein rat models of Parkinson's disease.

Consequently, while clinical trials in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have demonstrated the capacity of fetal-derived dopamine neurons to survive, integrate and alleviate symptoms, the non-permissive host environment has contributed to the incomplete re-innervation of the target tissue by ectopic grafts, and even more noticeable, the poor reconstruction of the midbrain dopamine pathways following homotopic midbrain grafting.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is supported histologically by the findings of α-synuclein immunopositive Lewy bodies and neurites and severe substantia nigra cell loss. 
There are very few published cases of Parkinson's disease in which no pathological abnormality was found, and some of these cases were in hindsight thought to have probably been cases of indeterminate senile tremor or dystonic tremor. 
RESULTS: 5 cases considered to have Parkinson's disease by neurologists throughout the entirety of their illness that lacked any histopathological findings known to be associated with Parkinson's syndromes were identified out of a total number of 773 brains with a final clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in the Queen Square Brain Bank.

We interrogated baseline single photon emission computed tomography scans of subjects recruited by the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative to determine: (i) the integrity of the brainstem raphe nuclei in early Parkinson's disease; and (ii) whether raphe serotonin transporter levels correlate with severity of tremor and symptoms of fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbance. 
Three hundred and forty-five patients with early drug-naïve Parkinson's disease, 185 healthy controls, and 56 subjects with possible Parkinson's disease without evidence of dopaminergic deficit were included. 
In the Parkinson's disease cohort, 37 patients had a tremulous, 106 patients had a pure akinetic-rigid, and 202 had a mixed phenotype. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease had significantly lower serotonin transporter availability in the brainstem raphe nuclei compared to controls (P < 0.01) and subjects without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (P < 0.05). 
However, only 13% of patients with Parkinson's disease individually had reduced signals. 
Raphe serotonin transporter availability over the entire Parkinson's disease cohort were associated with rest tremor amplitude (β = -0.106, P < 0.05), rest tremor constancy (β = -0.109, P < 0.05), and index of rest tremor severity (β = -0.104, P < 0.05). 
The tremulous Parkinson's disease subgroup had significantly lower raphe serotonin transporter availability but less severe striatal dopaminergic deficits compared to akinetic-rigid patients with no resting tremor (P < 0.05). 
There was no association between raphe serotonin transporter availability and fatigue, depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder in early Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that the raphe nuclei are affected in a subgroup of early drug-naïve Parkinson's disease patients and that reduced raphe serotonin transporter availability is associated with the severity of resting tremor but not non-motor symptoms.

 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a comorbid factor in Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of this review is to examine the recent neuroimaging findings in the search for Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI) biomarkers to gain insight on whether MCI and specific cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease implicate striatal dopamine or another system. 
On the other hand, motivational states in Parkinson's disease along with their behavioral and physiological indices suggest a noradrenergic contribution to cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, Parkinson's disease's pattern of neurodegeneration offers an avenue for continued research in nigrostriatal dopamine's role in distinct behaviors, as well as the specification of dorsal and ventral striatal functions. 
This may be due in part to MCI's broad definition, encompassing heterogeneous cognitive domains, only some of which are affected in Parkinson's disease. 
Given the deterioration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease, it has been the prime target of PD-MCI investigation. 
By testing well defined cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease, distinct functions can be attributed to specific neural systems, overcoming conflicting results on PD-MCI. 
Apart from dopamine, other systems such as the neurovascular or noradrenergic systems are affected in Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, the impact of both dopaminergic and noradrenergic deficiency on motivational states in Parkinson's disease is examined in light of a plausible link between apathy and cognitive deficits.

 In patients with Parkinson's disease and in animal models of this disorder, neurons in the basal ganglia and related regions in thalamus and cortex show changes that can be recorded by using electrophysiologic single-cell recording techniques, including altered firing rates and patterns, pathologic oscillatory activity and increased inter-neuronal synchronization. 
We here review the current knowledge of the electrophysiologic changes at the single cell level, the level of local populations of neural elements, and the level of the entire basal ganglia-thalamocortical network in parkinsonism, and discuss the possible use of this information to optimize treatment approaches to Parkinson's disease, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the contractile responsiveness of urinary bladder from the 6-OHDA unilateral rat model of Parkinson's disease with that of normal untreated animals. 
CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that it is not only the central dopamine control of the micturition reflex that is altered in Parkinson's disease, but also the local contractile function of the urinary bladder.

Neurons degenerating in Parkinson's disease also degenerate in normal aging, and the different agents involved in the etiology of this illness are also involved in aging. 
Senescence is a wider phenomenon affecting cells all over the body, whereas Parkinson's disease seems to be restricted to certain brain centers and cell populations. 
However, reviewed data suggest that Parkinson's disease may be a local expression of aging on cell populations which, by their characteristics (high number of synaptic terminals and mitochondria, unmyelinated axons, etc.), are highly vulnerable to the agents promoting aging. 
The development of new knowledge about Parkinson's disease could be accelerated if the research on aging and Parkinson's disease were planned together, and the perspective provided by gerontology gains relevance in this field.

Parkinson's disease results from a progressive loss of dopaminergic inputs to the striatum and leads to impairments in motivation and learning from feedback. 
However, the link between motivation and learning in Parkinson's disease is not well understood. 
We examined Locomotion and Assessment in patients with Parkinson's disease and age-matched controls. 
Parkinson's disease patients demonstrated a selective decrease in Assessment motivation but no change in Locomotion motivation, suggesting that Parkinson's disease leads to a reduced tendency to evaluate and monitor outcomes.

The objective was to determine whether a daily ultra-low dose of 40 micrograms of haloperidol could enhance the clinical action of levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients. 
While continuing their daily treatment with levodopa, 16 patients with Parkinson's disease were followed weekly for six weeks. 
The SPES/SCOPA scale (short scale for assessment of motor impairments and disabilities in Parkinson's disease) was administered before treatment and weekly throughout the trial. 
Such treatment for Parkinson's disease may possibly permit the levodopa dose to be reduced and, thus, delay the onset of levodopa side effects.

The results show that in 6-hydroxydopamine rat (neuroprotection) and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse (neurorescue) Parkinson's disease models, VAR significantly attenuated the loss of striatal dopamine levels, markedly reduced dopamine turnover, and increased tyrosine-hydroxylase levels. 
Our study indicates that the multitarget compound VAR exerted neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease and aging, further suggesting that a drug that can regulate multiple brain targets could be an ideal treatment-strategy for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders.

The present findings show that Tanshinone IIA may possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties and may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Four individuals stand out as pioneers of the early work that led to levodopa becoming a revolutionary new treatment for Parkinson's disease: Arvid Carlsson, Oleh Hornykiewicz, George C. 
This inspired Hornykiewicz to determine dopamine levels in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In the meantime, after his discovery of low dopamine in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, Hornykiewicz persuaded Walther Birkmayer to inject l-dopa into patients. 
The fulfilment of the l-dopa story stemmed from the hypothesis held by Cotzias that Parkinson's disease was caused by loss of brain neuromelanin in the substantia nigra. 
Both Cotzias and Yahr had encountered motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, but the amelioration of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor was so pronounced that these adverse effects did not prevent regulatory approval of l-dopa, and almost 50 years later l-dopa remains the most effective pharmacologic agent for treating Parkinson's disease. 
Cognitive impairments commonly occur in Parkinson's disease. 
 Long-term administration of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa), the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), is accompanied by fluctuations in its duration of action and motor complications (dyskinesia) that dramatically affect the quality of life of patients.

 The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. 
The aim of this study was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. 
Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson's disease, both "on" and "off" their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. 
Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson's disease in the "off" state. 
The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson's disease, implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. 
In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson's disease "off" state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. 
Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson's disease "on" state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson's disease when in the "off" state. 
Taken together our findings emphasize the central role of dopamine in integrated striatal function and the pathological consequences of striatal dopamine denervation in Parkinson's disease.

 Early and correct diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is critical for patient counseling and therapeutic management. 
Although dopamine neuron replacement in Parkinson's disease has been the focus of most clinical studies, great interest has been shown in this approach for other disorders, including Huntington's disease. 
 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Studies have reported higher prevalences of four behavioral addictions (binge eating, compulsive shopping, hypersexuality, and pathological gambling) in dopamine agonist-treated Parkinson's disease relative to non-dopamine agonist-treated Parkinson's. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition that affects motor function along with a wide range of cognitive domains, including executive function. 
Striatal dopamine reuptake is mediated by the SLC6A3 gene (formerly named DAT1) and its polymorphisms, which have been largely overlooked in Parkinson's disease. 
Thirty patients (ages 53-68 years; 19 males, 11 females) at early stages of Parkinson's disease, were genotyped according to a 9-repeat (9R) or 10-repeat (10R) allele on the SLC6A3/DAT1 gene. 
This is the first study indicating that the SLC6A3/DAT1 genotype has a significant effect on fronto-striatal activation and performance in Parkinson's disease. 
Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess this polymorphism's effect on the clinical evolution of patients with Parkinson's disease, especially with cognitive decline. 
 L-Dopa (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) is the precursor to dopamine and has become the mainstay therapeutic treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Chronic L-dopa is administered to recover motor function in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 L-Dopa has been used to increase dopamine concentrations in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. 
 Progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons is the neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Pharmacological dopamine (DA) replacement with Levodopa [L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)] is the gold standard treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The over-expression of α-synuclein is a major factor in the death of dopaminergic neurons in a methamphetamine-induced model of Parkinson's disease. 
At 2 weeks post-injection, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with methamphetamine to establish the model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The goal of this study was to increase the dopamine content and reduce dopaminergic metabolites in the brain of Parkinson's disease rats. 
Using high-performance liquid chromatography, we found that dopamine and dopaminergic metabolite (dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid) content in the midbrain of Parkinson's disease rats was increased after neural stem cell transplantation + Zhichan decoction, compared with neural stem cell transplantation alone. 
Our experimental findings show that after neural stem cell transplantation in Parkinson's disease rats, Zhichan decoction can promote differentiation of neural stem cells into dopaminergic neurons. 
 Previous studies have shown that baicalin prevented iron accumulation after substantia nigra injury, reduced divalent metal transporter 1 expression, and increased ferroportin 1 expression in the substantia nigra of rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease rats. 
In the current study, we investigated the relationship between iron accumulation and transferrin expression in C6 cells, to explore the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of baicalin on iron accumulation observed in Parkinson's disease rats. 
In the present study, we compared gray matter images of 32 patients with Parkinson's disease and 25 healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry based on 3.0 T high-field magnetic resonance T1-weighted imaging and clinical neurological scale scores. 
In particular, the scores of visuospa-tial/executive function items in Montreal Cognitive Assessment were significantly reduced, but mean scores of non-motor symptoms significantly increased, in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In dition, gray matter volume was significantly diminished in Parkinson's disease patients compared with normal controls, including bilateral temporal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe, bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral insular lobe, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral amygdale, right uncus, and right posterior lobe of the cerebellum. 
These findings indicate that voxel-based phometry can accurately and quantitatively assess the loss of gray matter volume in patients with Parkinson' disease, and provide essential neuroimaging evidence for multisystem pathological mechanisms involved in Parkinson's disease. 
Specifically, new possibilities are explored in relation to allosteric and orthosteric binding sites on dopamine receptors for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and on muscarinic receptors for Alzheimer's disease. 
For example, the design of bivalent drugs that can reach homo/hetero-dimers of D2 dopamine receptor holds promise as a relevant therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease. 
Bearing in mind the evidence of changes in the blood flow of basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease (PD), and the pivotal role of the dopaminergic mesostriatal pathway in the pathophysiology of this disease, here we studied whether striatal vessels receive inputs from midbrain dopaminergic neurons.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent hypokinetic movement disorder, and symptomatic PD pathogenesis has been ascribed to imbalances between the direct and indirect pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry. 
All above-mentioned results reveal that the short GONRs can provide a novel platform for electrochemically biomarker detection of Parkinson's disease. 
 Besides dopamine-deficiency related motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms, including cognitive changes occur in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, that may relate to accumulation of α-synuclein in the hippocampus (HC). 
These results support the presence of GP neuron subtypes and suggest that each subtype plays a different role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.

 Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are classified to be a recent new therapeutic strategy for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease, a hypokinetic movement disorder. 
 Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists represent a new way forward in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) through a non-dopaminergic mechanism. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with L-DOPA eventually causes abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias in most patients. 
In fact, the existence of putative striatalA2A/D2 receptor heteromers has been suggested to be important for striatal function under both normal and pathological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease.

 The aim of this study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Pelli-Robson and Ishihara diagnostic methods in differing Parkinson's disease from essential tremor compared to DaTSCAN (dopamine transporter scan) findings. 
The intention was to investigate whether visual dysfunction appears in the early state of Parkinson's disease. 
The study included 164 patients of which 59 (36.0%) suffered from Parkinson's disease, 51 (31.1%) from essential tremor, and 54 (32.9%) healthy patients which presented the control group. 
The specificity of Pelli-Robson test in confirming Parkinson's disease was 53% and the sensitivity 81.4%. 
The specificity of Ishihara test in confirming Parkinson's disease was 88.2%, and sensitivity 55.9%. 
We found that the colour and contrast dysfunction are present as the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
In this study the Pelli-Robson test is highly sensitive and the Ishihara tables are highly specific in the differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, but neither of these methods fulfils the criteria for the validity of a test.

 BACKGROUND: A major risk-factor for developing Parkinson's disease (PD) is genetic variability in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), most notably the p.G2019S mutation. 
While the vulnerability of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra to α-synuclein over-expression, and its link to Parkinson's disease, is well studied, animal models recapitulating the cortical degeneration in dementia with Lewy-bodies (DLB) are much less mature. 
 Altered dopamine homeostasis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Free radical-mediated neurodegeneration is one of the many causes of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In rodents, the characterisation of global and conditional isoform-specific knockouts suggests a contribution of Cav1.2 channels in spatial memory formation, whereas Cav1.3 channels seem to be involved in the consolidation of fear memories and in neurodegenerative mechanisms associated with the development of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration via apoptosis of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons associated with inflammation, resulting in behavioral anomalies.

We subsequently explored the possibility that pathogenic GCH1 variants could contribute to the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, even in the absence of a family history for DOPA-responsive dystonia. 
The frequency of GCH1 variants was evaluated in whole-exome sequencing data of 1318 cases with Parkinson's disease and 5935 control subjects. 
Our results show that rare GCH1 variants are associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease. 
Further insight into GCH1-associated pathogenetic mechanisms will shed light on the role of dopamine metabolism in nigral degeneration and Parkinson's disease.

 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Later stage Parkinson's disease, sometimes referred to as advanced disease, has been characterized by motor complication, as well as by the potential emergence of nonlevodopa responsive motor and nonmotor symptoms. 
The management of advanced stage Parkinson's disease can be complex. 
This review summarizes the currently available treatment strategies for addressing advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, we will address the current evidence supporting the treatment of nonmotor symptoms in the advanced Parkinson's disease patient. 
We will conclude by detailing the potential nonpharmacological and multidisciplinary approaches for advanced stage Parkinson's disease. 
SUMMARY: The optimization of levodopa is, in most cases, the most powerful therapeutic option available; however, medication optimization requires an advanced understanding of Parkinson's disease. 
Nonmotor symptoms will affect quality of life more than the motor Parkinson's disease symptoms, and these nonmotor symptoms should be aggressively treated. 
Many advanced Parkinson's disease patients will likely benefit from multi and interdisciplinary Parkinson's disease teams with multiple professionals collaborating to develop a collective and tailored strategy for an individual patient. 
It was a general belief for a long time that Parkinson's disease is without genetic component a sporadic disease. 
According to the present views the improper regulation of protein aggregation and a dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system may be the common pathway of sporadic and hereditary Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Whether Parkinson's disease (PD) influences suprathreshold changes in perceived odor intensity is unknown.

 Striatal dopamine (DA) is critically involved in major brain functions such as motor control and deficits such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine replacement therapy in the form of levodopa results in a significant proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease developing debilitating dyskinesia. 
 INTRODUCTION: Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) was recently linked to the development of impulse control disorders such as pathological gambling (PG), hypersexuality, compulsive shopping, and binge or compulsive eating. 
Based on the published literature describing Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the daily and cumulative doses of cabergoline are important factors.

 Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and a biochemical reduction of striatal dopamine levels. 
Despite the lack of fully understanding of the etiology of Parkinson's disease, accumulating evidences suggest that Parkinson's disease may be caused by the insufficient support of neurotrophic factors, and by microglial activation, resident immune cells in the brain. 
We have recently reported that naringin has neuroprotective effects in a neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease. 
Moreover, the production of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor by naringin treatment contributes to the protection of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection in a neurotoxin model of Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is among the most common of the neurodegenerative disorders. 
 INTRODUCTION: A major unresolved issue in the Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment is the development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) as a side effect of chronic L-DOPA administration. 
 Depression is a frequent comorbid disorder in Parkinson's disease and may antedate its motor symptoms. 
However, mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease-associated depression are unknown and its current medication is insufficient. 
The aim of the present study was to compare antidepressant-like effects of imipramine, fluoxetine and pramipexole in a model of preclinical stages of Parkinson's disease in rats. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) drug therapy remains a challenge. 
However, advances in magnetic resonance enable the separation of patients with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, and show great promise for differentiation between Parkinson's disease and other akinetic-rigid syndromes. 
Radionuclide imaging is useful to show the dopaminergic basis for both motor and behavioural complications of Parkinson's disease and its treatment, and alterations in non-dopaminergic systems. 
Both PET and MRI can be used to study patterns of functional connectivity in the brain, which is disrupted in Parkinson's disease and in association with its complications, and in other basal-ganglia disorders such as dystonia, in which an anatomical substrate is not otherwise apparent. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes currently available treatment options and treatment strategies, investigational treatments, and the importance of exercise for early Parkinson's disease. 
RECENT FINDINGS: The available treatment options for early Parkinson's disease have changed little in the past decade and include carbidopa/levodopa, dopamine agonists, and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors. 
We will also review several investigational treatments that have shown promise for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease, including a new extended release formulation of carbidopa/levodopa (IPX066), safinamide which inhibits MAO-B, dopamine uptake and glutamate and pardoprunox which is a 5HT-1A agonist and a partial dopamine agonist. 
Finally, we discuss recent studies focusing on exercise as an important component in the management of early Parkinson's disease. 
SUMMARY: Advances in the management of early Parkinson's disease include evolving treatment strategies, new investigational treatments, and earlier implementation of various forms of exercise. 
 Parkinson's disease is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a reduction of dopamine (DA) levels. 
 Achieving safe and readily accessible sources for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still a challenging unresolved issue. 
 BACKGROUND: Pain constitutes the major non motor syndrome in Parkinson's disease (PD) and includes neuropathic pain; however current drug therapies used to alleviate it have only limited efficacy. 
 Transdermal rotigotine (RTG) is a non-ergot dopamine agonist (D3>D2>D1), and is indicated for use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The diagnoses were: Parkinson's disease with dementia, multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian type, multiple system atrophy cerebellar type, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degenerative changes of nigral dopamine neurons, resulting in the dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. 
Induced dopaminergic (iDA) neurons can be generated by direct conversion of skin fibroblasts; however, their in vivo phenotypic and functional properties remain incompletely understood, leaving their impact on Parkinson's disease (PD) cell therapy and modeling uncertain. 
 Cell replacement for restoring neuronal populations in Parkinson's disease has been demonstrated as a potential therapeutic strategy over several decades of studies; however, a number of issues regarding sources of replacement neurons and optimization of therapeutic efficacy in vivo have hampered clinical implementation. 
In this issue of the JCI, Dell'Anno and colleagues evaluated the use of induced dopaminergic (iDA) neurons that were generated by direct fibroblast reprogramming for transplantation and demonstrated that postmitotic iDA neurons stably and functionally integrate into host striatum to produce motor improvements in 6-OHDA rats, a Parkinson's disease model. 
 In addition to the classical motor symptoms, motivational and affective deficits are core impairments of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The synthesis of NM in those neurons is a component of brain aging and there is the evidence that this pigment can be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current investigation was to explore whether salivary DJ-1 could be a potential biomarker for monitoring disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) by evaluating the association between salivary DJ-1 concentrations and nigrostriatal dopaminergic function. 
 Drug-induced parkinsonism is the second most common cause of parkinsonism after Parkinson's disease and their distinction has crucial implications in terms of management and prognosis. 
Finally, preliminary evidence exists for sympathetic cardiac scintigraphy to predict dopaminergic pathway abnormalities and to differentiate between drug-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. 
Imaging of the dopaminergic pathway seems to be the only, reasonably available, technique to aid the differential diagnosis between drug-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra are particularly prone to degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
Their selective loss causes the major motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but the causes for the high vulnerability of SN DA neurons, compared to neighbouring, more resistant ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, are still unclear. 
Consequently, there is still no cure available for Parkinson's disease. 
D2-autoreceptors and Cav1.3-containing L-type Ca(2+) channels both contribute to Parkinson's disease pathology. 
L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers protect SN DA neurons from degeneration in Parkinson's disease and its mouse models, and they are in clinical trials for neuroprotective Parkinson's disease therapy. 
Mature SN DA neurons display prominent, non-desensitizing somatodendritic D2-autoreceptor responses that show pronounced desensitization in PARK-gene Parkinson's disease mouse models. 
We analysed surviving human SN DA neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease and from controls, and detected elevated messenger RNA levels of D2-autoreceptors and GIRK2 in Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, we detected elevated substantia nigra dopamine messenger RNA levels of NCS-1 (but not Cav1.2 or Cav1.3) after cocaine in mice, as well as in remaining human SN DA neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, our findings provide a novel homeostatic functional link in SN DA neurons between Cav1.3- L-type-Ca(2+) channels and D2-autoreceptor activity, controlled by NCS-1, and indicate that this adaptive signalling network (Cav1.3/NCS-1/D2/GIRK2) is also active in human SN DA neurons, and contributes to Parkinson's disease pathology. 
 The adaptive immune system has implications in pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis is a potential approach to compensate for loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra compacta nigra (SNpc) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

This signaling bias is proposed to explain behavioral activity in both rat and primate Parkinson's disease models, and a D1-D2 heterodimer has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. 
 BACKGROUND: Whether initial treatment for Parkinson's disease should consist of levodopa, dopamine agonists, or monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors (MAOBI) is uncertain. 
We aimed to establish which of these three classes of drug, as initial treatment, provides the most effective long-term control of symptoms and best quality of life for people with early Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: In this pragmatic, open-label randomised trial, patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned (by telephone call to a central office; 1:1:1) between levodopa-sparing therapy (dopamine agonists or MAOBI) and levodopa alone. 
Primary outcomes were the mobility dimension on the 39-item patient-rated Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39) quality-of-life scale (range 0-100 with six points defined as the minimally important difference) and cost-effectiveness. 
 Animals treated with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ODHA) injections, an animal model of Parkinson's disease, exhibit deficits in memory for temporal order, but show intact novel object recognition.

 Dopaminergic medication in Parkinson's disease has been proposed to improve cognitive processing by modulating the severely depleted dorsal striatum, while impairing reward processing by modulating the relatively intact ventral striatum. 
Here we fill this gap by scanning Parkinson's disease patients (n=15) ON and relatively OFF their dopaminergic medication using functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypertension has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), but data on antihypertensive drugs and PD are inconclusive. 
Loss of dopamine signaling is the major abnormality in Parkinson's disease.

 The most effective treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) L-DOPA is associated with major side effects, in particular L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, which motivates development of new treatment strategies. 
 OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic options for Parkinson's disease mainly consist of L-dopa and dopamine agonists. 
METHODS AND PATIENTS: We used medical claim data from January 2005 to December 2010 for Parkinson's disease patients older than 30 years who were prescribed anti-Parkinson drugs. 
RESULTS: L-dopa was the most frequently prescribed drug for Parkinson's disease (2005, 58%; 2010, 51%). 
CONCLUSION: L-dopa was the mainstay of Parkinson's disease treatment between 2005 and 2010 in Japan. 
 In the recent years, the serotonin system has emerged as a key player in the induction of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
In line with this view, removal of serotonin neurons by selective toxin, or pharmacological silencing of their activity, produced complete suppression of LID in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Since the 1960's treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) have traditionally been directed to restore or replace dopamine, with L-Dopa being the gold standard. 
 Two genes linked to early onset Parkinson's disease, PINK1 and Parkin, encode a protein kinase and a ubiquitin-ligase, respectively. 
Patients consisted of three subgroups: nine patients whose diagnoses were unclear concerning whether they had idiopathic Parkinson's disease or drug-induced parkinsonism ('PD/DIP'), nine patients who fulfilled neither the diagnostic criteria of PD nor of essential tremor ('PD/ET'), and six patients who were alleged to have either PD or atypical parkinsonian syndrome ('PD/APS'). 
We investigated the feasibility of automated analysis for dopamine transporter images using this technique and evaluated striatal binding potentials in Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-(123)I-iodophenyl)tropane ((123)I-beta-CIT) SPECT images acquired from 26 people with Parkinson's disease (M:F = 11:15, mean age = 49 ± 12 years), 9 people with Wilson's disease (M: F = 6:3, mean age = 26 ± 11 years) and 17 normal controls (M:F = 5:12, mean age = 39 ± 16 years). 
The striatal binding potentials of participants with Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease were significantly lower than those of normal controls. 
This procedure allows an objective and quantitative comparison of the binding potential, which in this case showed a significantly decreased binding potential in the striata of patients with Parkinson's disease or Wilson's disease. 
 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of FP-CIT PET template-based quantitative analysis on F-18 FP-CIT PET in patients with de novo Parkinson's disease (PD), compared with MR-based and manual methods. 
 A substantial subset of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suffers from impulse control disorders (ICDs), which are side effects of dopaminergic medication.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a challenging condition where different therapeutic options have evolved over the course of the last 50 years. 
 Cells maintain healthy mitochondria by degrading damaged mitochondria through mitophagy; defective mitophagy is linked to Parkinson's disease. 
Here we report that USP30, a deubiquitinase localized to mitochondria, antagonizes mitophagy driven by the ubiquitin ligase parkin (also known as PARK2) and protein kinase PINK1, which are encoded by two genes associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Thus USP30 inhibition is potentially beneficial for Parkinson's disease by promoting mitochondrial clearance and quality control. 
Pharmacological modulation of A2ARs is particularly useful in Parkinson's disease (PD) due to their property of antagonizing dopamine D2 receptor activity. 
 Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse may be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD); a problematic event as approximately 33 million people abuse Meth worldwide.

 Gain-of-function mutations of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) are known to trigger Parkinson's disease (PD) with striatal dopaminergic deficits and a reduction of spontaneous movements. 
Lesions or high frequency stimulation of the hyperactive subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's disease (PD), alleviate the motor symptoms and reduce dyskinesia, either directly and/or by allowing the reduction of the L-DOPA dose.

Based on recent experimental data from animal models of Parkinson's disease in rodents and non-human primates and also from parkinsonian patients, this review summarizes current knowledge on the role of dopamine in the modulation of basal ganglia neuronal activity and also the role of dopamine depletion in these nuclei in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
As a first step to show this association in an experimental setting in humans, we studied whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which modulates the basal ganglia circuitry, alters basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) or insulin sensitivity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Impulse control disorders (ICD), including pathological gambling, are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and tend to improve after subthalamic (STN) stimulation after a marked reduction of dopaminergic medication.

 The serotonin system has emerged as a potential target for anti-dyskinetic therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
Accordingly, drugs able to dampen the activity of serotonin neurons can suppress L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

 About a half a century has passed since dopamine was identified as a neurotransmitter, and it has been several decades since it was established that people with Parkinson's disease receive motor symptom relief from oral levodopa. 
Since VP patients generally have a poorer response to l-Dopa than Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, we investigated whether levels of relevant CSF neurotransmitter metabolites may be differentially altered in VP and PD and assessed the potential of neurotransmitter metabolites as biomarkers. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder classically characterized by the death of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and by intracellular Lewy bodies composed largely of α-synuclein. 
The haloperidol-induced catalepsy is a state of akinesia and rigidity very similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. 
On the basis of extrapolations from rat to human doses, we hypothesize that low oral doses of bexarotene may provide an effective and tolerated therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
To address the potential use of dopaminergic Müller cells as a source of dopamine in cell therapy procedures, we used a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, in which mouse Müller cells with the dopaminergic phenotype were transplanted into the striatum of hemi-parkinsonian mice generated by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: L-DOPA is generally considered to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease by its conversion to dopamine. 
 This review examines the involvement of the motor cortex in Parkinson's disease (PD), a debilitating movement disorder typified by degeneration of dopamine cells of the substantia nigra. 
The most suitable candidates for DBS suffer from Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesias that are not adequately controlled with optimized medical therapy, or with medication-refractory tremor. 
Most patients corresponding to this profile suffer from a relatively young onset of Parkinson's disease, and are aged less than 70 years at the time of surgery. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder in Europe, affecting more than two million people between 50 and 70 years of age. 
 The mechanisms for the emergence and transmission of synchronized oscillations in Parkinson's disease, which are potentially causal to motor deficits, remain debated. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder and is caused by severe degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
 Clinical observations report a greater propensity to develop Parkinson's disease (PD) in amphetamine users. 
 INTRODUCTION: The Mexican Registry of Parkinson´s disease (ReMePARK) is nested within a multicentric cohort aimed to describe motor, non-motor, and genetic determinants of Parkinson's disease in Mexican patients. 
RESULTS: A total of 607 male and 476 female subjects with Parkinson's disease were included. 
CONCLUSION: Subjects with Parkinson's disease incorporated into ReMePARK are comparable with other international registries, with the exception of the years of formal education, time to diagnosis, and the use of dopamine agonists. 
The characterization of the Mexican population with Parkinson's disease will improve diagnosis and therapeutic management as well as define research efforts in this area. 
 A liquid chromatographic chiral stationary phase based on (+)-(18-crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid was applied to the resolution of 15 analytes, including racemic rasagiline, a chiral drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and its analogues. 
 Long-term l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a condition thought to primarily involve the dopamine D1 receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the nigrostriatal system and by the presence of Lewy bodies (LB), proteinaceous inclusions mainly composed of filamentous α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates. 
These detailed quantitative data on dopamine transporter-positive innervation in the human amygdaloid complex can offer a useful reference in future studies aimed at analysing putative dysfunctions of this system in diseases involving brain dopamine, such as certain anxiety disorders, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 BACKGROUND: Depression is a common non-motor symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the efficacy and acceptability of therapeutic methods for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease. 
TCAs might be the best choice when starting antidepressant treatment in patients of Parkinson's disease because it has the most favorable balance between benefits and acceptability, followed by pramipexole and SNRIs, SSRIs might be the last choice. 
In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of mangiferin against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is most popular and widely used to evaluate therapeutic implications of new protective agents. 
This condition, which is different from both obsessive-compulsive disorder and mania, is still underestimated in patients with Parkinson's disease and may have deleterious social consequences on patients and their families. 
The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone, an FDA-approved treatment for Parkinson's disease, increases prefrontal dopamine levels, with cognitive benefits that may vary by COMT genotype. 
 OBJECTIVES: In healthy subjects, fatiguing exercises induce a period of post-exercise corticomotor depression (PECD) that is absent in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Because dopamine is believed to stimulate adult neurogenesis, we looked for possible variations in the dopaminergic innervation of the subventricular zone between cases of Huntington's chorea and Parkinson's diseases. 
The immunohistochemical approach was applied to postmortem tissue from 2 Parkinson's disease cases, 4 Huntington's disease cases, along with age-matched controls. 
An intense TH+ zone was detected along the ventricular border of the caudate nucleus in Huntington's disease cases, but not in patients with Parkinson's disease or age-matched controls. 
The dopamine innervation of the subventricular zone is strikingly massive in Huntington's chorea compared to Parkinson's disease, a finding that concurs with the marked increase in neurogenesis noted in the subventricular zone of Huntington's disease patients. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum. 
 BACKGROUND: We applied the idea of synergies and the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis to explore the effects of dopamine replacement therapy on finger interaction and coordination in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Some biochemical and histological studies of Parkinson's disease patients' brains and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats suggest that dopaminergic dennervation of the striatum leads to the nitrergic system hypofunction in this structure. 
Hence, recently the modulation of nitric oxide (NO)- soluble guanylyl cyclase-cyclic GMP signaling is considered to be a new target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Local field potential (LFP) recordings in humans with Parkinson's disease undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) indicate that spectral changes both anticipate movement and occur perimovement.

 We explored the impact of Nox-2 in modulating inflammatory-mediated microglial responses in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model. 
 Increasingly memory deficits are recognized in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, experimental evidence for impaired temporal processing in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is mixed. 
Promising evidence has demonstrated potential utility of a number of allosteric modulators of GPCRs in multiple CNS disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as psychiatric or neurobehavioral diseases such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and addiction. 
 Much controversy exists concerning the effect of levodopa on striatal dopaminergic markers in Parkinson's disease (PD) and its influence on functional neuroimaging. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder behind Alzheimer's disease. 
 Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown beneficial effects in models of Parkinson's disease. 
 In the previous report (Sonia Angeline et al., 2012), we showed an altered expression of protective proteins in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD)-like rat model. 
 BACKGROUND: Abnormal posture (AP) is often seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), and marked forms known as dropped head syndrome and camptocormia encumber daily living activities. 
 Numerous studies have suggested that alpha-synuclein plays a prominent role in both familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with l-DOPA is the standard treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The deposition of α-syn (α-synuclein) as amyloid fibrils and the selective loss of DA (dopamine) containing neurons in the substantia nigra are two key features of PD (Parkinson's disease). 
 Motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is believed to arise primarily from pathophysiology in the dorsal striatum and its related corticostriatal and thalamostriatal circuits during progressive dopamine denervation. 
 The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism model, particularly in non-human primates, remains the gold-standard for studying the pathogenesis and assessing novel therapies for Parkinson's disease. 
 Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are commonly treated using l-DOPA although long-term treatment usually causes debilitating motor side effects including dyskinesias. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease afflicting about 1% of people over 65 years old and 4-5% of people over 85 years. 
 To compare the effects of intravenous amantadine and placebo therapy on freezing of gait in patients with Parkinson's disease, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial compared the efficacy of 5 days intravenous amantadine and placebo treatments on freezing of gait in 42 subjects randomly allocated 2:1 to amantadine or placebo groups. 
Changes in freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q) scores and in unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores, from baseline to immediately (V1) and 1 month (V2) after treatments, were assessed. 
 The effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on hand-eye coordination and corrective response control during reach-to-grasp tasks remains unclear. 
It is, therefore, proposed that the cAMP-ERK1/2-Bad signaling pathways incurred by toxic levels of 6-OHDA play a role in dopamine neuron death of animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Impulse control disorders (ICD) are increasingly recognized in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly when treated with commonly used dopamine agonists such as pramipexole and ropinirole. 
The hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. 
Marked loss of LC-noradrenergic (NAergic) neurons is observed in autopsy specimens of patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD), and part of the clinical symptoms of these diseases may be related to dysfunction of the LC. 
Such cooperative synthesis of DA is considered as a compensatory reaction under a failure of DA-ergic neurons, for example, in neurodegenerative diseases like hyperprolactinemia and Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a slowly ongoing neuronal death. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder, predominantly affecting the dopamine-producing neurons residing at the substantia nigra. 
 We used ramelteon to treat two patients with secondary REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) complications along with neurodegenerative diseases including multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, a major complication of treatment of PD, are associated with molecular and functional alterations occurring into the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the dorsal striatum, a key areas involved in the control of motor activity. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), dopamine-agonist (DA) therapy has been associated with increased impulsive behavior. 
Abnormalities of dopamine neurotransmission occur in Parkinson's disease, and a number of substances that interfere with this system produce Parkinsonian symptoms and clinical signs, including notably 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which is the precursor of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with a strong genetic component to both the familial and sporadic forms.

 Burst firing has been reported as a pathological activity of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
We tested whether inhibiting D5R constitutive activity depresses burst firing and alleviates motor impairments in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These results are the first to demonstrate that subthalamic D5Rs are involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and that administering an inverse agonist of these receptors may lessen motor symptoms. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disease. 
 Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is mainly a presynaptic protein that has been implicated in Parkinson's disease and various other neurodegenerative disorders. 
 BACKGROUND: Wearing-off (WO) refers to the exacerbation of motor and/or non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease at the end of dose of dopaminergic medications. 
METHODS: Here, we report 2 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease with dementia, who experienced anxiety as non-motor symptom of WO under stable levodopa therapy. 
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that rotigotine at low dose might improve non-motor symptoms of WO in elderly patients suffering from Parkinson's disease with dementia, without raising major safety issues. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by a slow loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to significant decrease in dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum. 
An analysis of potential future therapies of Parkinson's disease suggests that some progress in this field has been made. 
 INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurobehavioral disorder defined by its motor features. 
 Signal abnormalities of the substantia nigra and the olfactory tract detected either by diffusion tensor imaging, including measurements of mean diffusivity, a parameter of brain tissue integrity, and fractional anisotropy, a parameter of neuronal fibre integrity, or transcranial sonography, were recently reported in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, changes in the nigral and olfactory diffusion tensor signal, as well as nigral echogenicity, were correlated with clinical scales of motor disability, odour function and putaminal dopamine storage capacity measured with 6-[(18)F] fluorolevodopa positron emission tomography in early and advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. 
Diffusion tensor imaging, transcranial sonography and positron emission tomography were performed on 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (mean disease duration 3.7 ± 3.7 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 to 4) and 14 age-matched healthy control subjects. 
When compared with the healthy control group, the Parkinson's disease group showed significant signal changes in the caudate and putamen by 6-[(18)F] fluorolevodopa positron emission tomography, in the substantia nigra by transcranial sonography, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively) and in the olfactory tract by mean diffusivity (P < 0.05). 
This study reports a significant association between increased mean diffusivity signal and decreased 6-[(18)F] fluorolevodopa uptake, indicating that microstructural degradation of the substantia nigra and the olfactory tract parallels progression of putaminal dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. 
 Currently available dopaminergic drugs such as levodopa and dopamine (DA) receptor agonists impart considerable improvement in Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms but often lead to significant motor complications including "wearing-off" and dyskinesia. 
 Currently, several studies addresses the novel link between sleep and dopaminergic neurotransmission, focusing most closely on the mechanisms by which Parkinson's disease (PD) and sleep may be intertwined. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects about 1% of the over 60 population and is characterized by a combination of motor symptoms (rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, stooped posture and freezing of gait [FoG]) and non-motor symptoms (including psychiatric and cognitive disorders). 
METHODS: We searched the PubMed database up until July 2013 with logical combinations of the following search terms: "Parkinson's disease", "gait", "cognition", "apathy", "advanced stage", "modulation", "noradrenergic", "cholinergic", "glutamatergic" and "neurotransmission". 
To explore this question, we used the attentional boost test in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) before and after the administration of dopaminergic medications. 
 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate changes in the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in nursing facility patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from 2005 to 2010 and to compare these to historical data from 1992 to 1996. 
 The nitrocatechol derivatives tolcapone (1) and entacapone (2), used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, were investigated for their potential to inhibit the tau-derived-hexapeptide 306VQIVYK311. 
 Executive dysfunction can be present from the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Impairments of synaptic plasticity are a hallmark of several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) which results from the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to abnormal activity within the basal ganglia (BG) network and pathological motor symptoms. 
 The serotonin system has recently emerged as an important player in the appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in experimental models of Parkinson's disease, as it provides an unregulated source of L-DOPA-derived dopamine release in the dopamine-depleted striatum. 
Accordingly, toxin lesion or pharmacological silencing of serotonin neurons suppressed LID in the rat and monkey models of Parkinson's disease. 
These data further confirm the involvement of the serotonin system in the appearance of LID, and suggest that 5-HTP may be useful to counteract the appearance of dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease patients. 
This study compares once-daily and twice-daily RPR in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We enrolled Parkinson's disease patients on dopamine agonist therapy with unsatisfactory control such as motor fluctuation, dyskinesia and sleep-related problems. 
 14-3-3 proteins have been confirmed to be involved in Parkinson's disease. 
In preclinical studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke and other neurodegenerative disorders, it has been shown that most GLP-1 mimetics cross the blood-brain barrier and show impressive neuroprotective effects in numerous studies. 
Oxidative stress and glutamatergic overactivity are key biochemical features accompanying the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that characterizes Parkinson's disease (PD). 
It is now known that multiple serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptors regulate extrapyramidal motor functions, which are implicated in pathogenesis and/or treatment of various neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal motor deficits). 
In addition, activation of 5-HT1A receptors also improves antipsychotic-induced EPS and motor disabilities in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 The results of the large-scale study STRIDE-PD of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are presented. 
 Dopaminergic replacement therapy (DRT) is effective in treatment the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) but can lead to impulse control disorders (ICD) in some patients. 
The changes in the neuroglial interactions in the striatum that lead to the disbalance of neuromediator systems in the basal nuclei may underlie the dysfunction of the basal nuclei in some diseases including Parkinson's disease. 
 Present study focused on the evaluation of aqueous extract of Sida cordifolia (AESC), and its different fractions; hexane (HFSC), chloroform (CFSC) and aqueous (AFSC), against rotenone induced biochemical, neurochemical, histopathological and behavioral alterations in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Recently, cases of early-onset Parkinson's disease in adults have been reported, collectively suggesting a role for disrupted dopaminergic neurotransmission in the observed neuropsychiatric phenotypes. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Selective MAO type B (MAO-B) inhibitors are effective in potentiation of the clinical effect of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease, but dopamine (DA) is deaminated mainly by MAO type A (MAO-A) in rat brain. 
CONCLUSION: Talipexole is registered for use as a dopamine substitute in humans with Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Impulsive-compulsive behaviours (ICBs) are frequent complications of Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with treatment by dopamine agonists (DAs). 
METHODS: A subsample of 72 patients of a large longitudinal study (n = 739) was screened with the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease (QUIP). 
As the D2 class of MSNs is highly implicated in Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders, our findings may contribute to understanding and treating the changes that occur in these pathological states. 
 AIM: It is well known that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) prominently experience difficulty in smelling, a nonmotor symptom, without any signs or symptoms from an early stage. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by progressive loss of dopamine neurons, leading to loss of motor coordination. 
 The defining pathogenic feature of Parkinson's disease is the age-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
Mutations and inactivation of parkin, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, induce Parkinson's disease through accumulation of pathogenic substrates. 
These data indicate that brain-permeable PARP inhibitors could effectively delay or prevent disease progression in Parkinson's disease. 
Nowadays, there is an enormous interest in the development of new dopamine receptors (DR) acting drugs as potential new targets for the treatment of schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease. 
 Beneficial effects of angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1) inhibition have been observed in a number of brain processes mediated by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, including Parkinson's disease. 
In a rat model of Parkinson's disease treated with L-DOPA, no differences in striatal dopamine and serotonin levels were observed between candesartan-treated rats and untreated, which suggests that chronic treatment with candesartan does not significantly affect the process of L-DOPA decarboxylation and dopamine release in Parkinson's disease patients. 
These mechanisms contribute to effectiveness and well tolerability of ZNS as an adjunct treatment for Parkinson's disease during l-DOPA monotherapy. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, impairs motor skills and cognitive function. 
 No safe, tolerated, and effective treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is available; however, clozapine and quetiapine are often used off-label. 
Many diseases such as depression, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with abnormal DA levels, implicating DAT as a factor in their etiology. 
The model will be a useful research tool in studies of movement and reward and associated pathologies such as Parkinson's disease and addiction. 
DAT trafficking is modulated by the Parkinson's disease-linked protein alpha-synuclein, but the contribution of synuclein family members beta-synuclein and gamma-synuclein to DAT trafficking is not known. 
 The pathogenic mechanism(s) contributing to loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain obscure. 
 BACKGROUND: Metabolic impairment contributes to development of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Presynaptic dopaminergic deficiency on dopamine transporter imaging supports a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and correlates with the severity of rigidity and bradykinesia. 
METHODS: A randomly selected cross section of 83 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who had [(123) I] FP-CIT SPECT at the time of clinical diagnosis was identified. 
 Males have a higher risk for developing Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism after ischemic stroke than females. 
Although estrogens have been shown to play a neuroprotective role in Parkinson's disease, there is little information on androgens' actions on dopamine neurons. 
Our data provide the first evidence that inhibition of cathepsin X protects both, PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells against 6-OHDA toxicity and indicate that cathepsin X may be responsible for dopamine neuron death, involved in the pathogenic cascade event for the neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 The exact pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unknown and proper mechanisms that correspond to the disease remain unidentified. 
This paper expands on the specific impact of mitochondrial genetic change and production of free radicals as well as its correlation to the neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: Unmedicated Parkinson's disease patients tend to be risk-averse while dopaminergic treatment causes a tendency to take risks. 
Our objective was to determine if patients with Parkinson's disease on or off levodopa showed differences in their perception of value when making decisions under risk. 
Eighteen age-matched controls and eighteen patients with Parkinson's disease before and after levodopa were tested. 
RESULTS: Patients with Parkinson's disease, on or off levodopa, were similar to controls when evaluating gains. 
CONCLUSION: While pre-medicated patients with Parkinson's disease show risk-aversion for large losses, patients on levodopa have normal perception of magnitude and probability for both loss and gain. 
 The dopamine precursor, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), is the preferred drug for Parkinson's disease, but long-term treatment results in the drug-induced dyskinesias and other side effects. 
The results demonstrated that melatonin, but not L-DOPA, restored spine density and spine morphology of medium spiny neurons in the striatum and suggest that melatonin could be an ideal adjuvant to L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease, and by the use of this neurohormone, it is possible to bring down the therapeutic doses of L-DOPA. 
In conditions of highly reduced or highly elevated dopamine levels the simulations predict that relative changes in the dopamine signal can no longer be decoded, which might explain why cognitive deficits are observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, or induced through drugs blocking dopamine reuptake. 
The surface electromyography results were consistent with features of the typical rest tremor, and the increased glucose metabolism in the putamen, seen on positron emission tomography scan, was consistent with the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), bradykinesia, or slowness of movement, only appears after a large striatal dopamine depletion. 
 Previous studies have suggested that impaired striatal dopamine function might be independently related to depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the results are not uniform. 
 Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, is an effective and well-tolerated dopamine replacement agent used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD).

Here we show that in transcription factor Pitx3 gene mutant mice with a severe DA loss in the dorsal striatum mimicking the DA denervation in Parkinson's disease (PD), the striatopallidal GABAergic synaptic transmission displayed a heightened sensitivity to presynaptic D2R-mediated inhibition with the dose-response curve shifted to the left, although the maximal inhibition was not changed.

 Dopamine (DA) depletion in the nigrostriatal system leads to basal ganglia dysfunction both in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats with neuronal hyperactivity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), i.e. 
 BACKGROUND: Mutations in the human α-synuclein gene lead to early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD); however, phenotypes of α-synuclein mutant mice vary depending upon the promoter driving transgene expression. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and an accompanying neuroinflammatory process in the substantia nigra (SN). 
 BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonist therapy is the main risk factor for impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Throughout the past decade it has been recognized that dopaminergic medication administered to remedy motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease is associated with an enhanced risk for impulse control disorders and related compulsive behaviors such as hobbyism, punding, and the dopamine dysregulation syndrome. 
Here we present a systematic overview of literature published between 2000 and January 2013 reporting impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease. 
We consider prevalence rates and discuss the functional neuroanatomy, the impact of dopamine-serotonin interactions, and the cognitive symptomatology associated with impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, perspectives for future research and management of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease are discussed. 
Parkin substrates include two septins; SEPT4/CDCrel-2 which coaggregates with α-synuclein as Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, and its closest homolog SEPT5/CDCrel-1/PNUTL1 whose overload with viral vector can rapidly eliminate dopamine neurons in rats. 
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that septin dysregulations commonly found in postmortem human brains with Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders may be responsible for a subset of behavioral abnormalities in the patients. 
 Cell therapy is a promising experimental treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In this review we provide evidence suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in dopamine's mediated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress changes in Parkinson's disease. 
We suggest that manipulating brain angiotensin may constitute an effective neuroprotective strategy for Parkinson's disease.

Mechanisms regulating experience-dependent changes in AMPAR expression may provide innovative therapeutic targets to increase the efficacy of treatments for basal ganglia disorders, including Parkinson's disease. 
 The pathological processes underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) involve more than dopamine cell loss within the midbrain. 
 OBJECTIVE: Age of onset is considered a poor prognostic factor for subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) outcome in the case of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) was evaluated in 4 combinations of Med/DBS on/off. 
Coupled with the effect of local dopaminergic denervation in the subthalamic nucleus, this is likely to affect the responsiveness of subthalamic neurons to their hyperdirect inputs in Parkinson's disease. 
A classic hypothesis in Parkinson's disease suggests that following dopaminergic denervation, the discharge of cells in the substantia nigra pars reticulata increases, thereby intensifying the inhibitory influence that this structure exerts on its targets in the thalamus and brainstem. 
 The participation of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been validated. 
 Rotenone is an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I that produces a model of Parkinson's disease (PD), in which neurons undergo dopamine release dysfunction and other features. 
 We combined viral vector delivery of human glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) with the grafting of dopamine (DA) precursor cells from fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM) to determine whether these strategies would improve the anti-Parkinson's effects in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys, an animal model for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This study was aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of TSG in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropypridine (MPTP)-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 There is growing evidence that Parkinson's disease, generally characterized by motor symptoms, also causes cognitive impairment such as spatial disorientation. 
DA loss is known to be the cause of Parkinson's disease and therefore it has been hypothesized that the associated spatial disorientation could result from hippocampal dysfunction. 
 Dopaminergic medication for motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) recently has been linked with impulse control disorders, including pathological gambling (PG), which affects up to 8% of patients.

 BACKGROUND: 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces Parkinson's disease (PD)-like neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) via its oxidized product, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), which is transported by the dopamine (DA) transporter into DA nerve terminals.

Nowadays, there is an enormous interest in the development of new drugs acting at the dopamine receptors (DR) as potential new targets for the treatment of schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, they are potential candidates to be used in the treatment of schizophrenia (antagonists) or Parkinson's disease (agonists) due to their scarce D1 DR-associated side effects.

Nigral dopaminergic neurons from POLGD257A mice accumulate mitochondrial DNA deletions to a similar extent (∼40-60%) as patients with Parkinson's disease and aged individuals. 
These results indicate that primary accumulation of mitochondrial DNA deletions within substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, at an extent similar to that observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, do not kill dopaminergic neurons but trigger neuroprotective compensatory mechanisms at a mitochondrial level that may account for the high pathogenic threshold of mitochondrial DNA deletions in these cells.

This study has thus revealed the presence of the proNGF-sortilin signaling complex in nigral dopamine neurons and its response to aging, lactacystin and 6-OHDA insults, suggesting that it might contribute to neuronal apoptosis or neurodegeneration during pathogenesis and disease progression of Parkinson's disease; the underlying mechanism and key signaling pathways involved warrant further investigation.

 Studies of patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopamimetics report conflicting evidence for early learning of probabilistic cue-outcome associations that elicits frontal-striatal activity. 
The current study examined the effects of dopaminergic therapies on probabilistic association learning in 13 patients with schizophrenia and 8 patients with Parkinson's disease under two conditions: after withdrawal from dopaminergic treatment and following administration of appropriate dopaminergic treatment. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease failed to demonstrate any significant improvement over 150 trials, under both conditions (receiving or withdrawn from dopamimetics). 
These results demonstrate an effect of dopamine (DA) signaling on probabilistic association learning in that: (1) dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease is insufficient to significantly improve probabilistic association learning and (2) DA receptor blockade impairs and removal of DA receptor blockade significantly improves frontal-striatal-dependent probabilistic association learning in schizophrenia, which is a novel finding and is opposite to the effects shown following removal of DA receptor blockade on other cognitive domains reported previously.

As Parkinson's disease is mainly characterized by a dysfunction of the sensorimotor pathways, which can be influenced by levodopa administration, the present study investigated the functional connectivity changes within the sensorimotor resting-state network in drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease after acute levodopa administration. 
Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 20 drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease, immediately before and 60 min after, oral administration of either levodopa or placebo. 
At the anatomical level, levodopa enhanced the sensorimotor network functional connectivity in the supplementary motor area, a region where drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited reduced signal fluctuations compared with untreated patients. 
The reported effects induced by levodopa on sensorimotor network topological and spectral features confirm that the sensorimotor system is a target of acute levodopa administration in drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Moreover, while the regional changes in supplementary motor area reflect the functional improvement in motor function, the rhythm-specific modulation induced by the dopamine precursor discloses a novel aspect of pharmacological stimulation in Parkinson's disease, adding further insight to the comprehension of levodopa action. 
 Parkinson's disease, the most common neurological disorder in the elderly, is characterized by progressive extrapyramidal motor dysfunction including resting tremors, muscle rigidity, hypolocomotion (bradykinesia and akinesia) and postural instability.

These findings encourage research into new 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands, which will improve efficacy and/or ameliorate adverse reactions in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms is generally asymmetric, reflecting differential extent of nigral pathology and resulting dopamine depletion in each of the hemispheres. 
Its neuropathological features overlap those of both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and the neuropathological hallmarks are therefore uncertain. 
Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity is a strong risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease later in life and further research is required to determine if the observed abnormality in stimulant users is associated with a functional deficit of the nigro-striatal system. 
l-Deprenyl and rasagiline, both selective MAO-B inhibitors, are used in the management of Parkinson's disease, but these drugs may be useful in the treatment of other neurodegenerative disorders given that they demonstrate neuroprotective/neurorescue properties in a wide variety of models in vitro and in vivo. 
This effect may contribute to the influence of D3R ligands on reward, cognition, and processes disrupted in schizophrenia, drug abuse, and Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, abnormalities in their signaling are implicated in the etiology or pathology of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

 L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a common side effect developed after chronic treatment with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) in Parkinson's disease. 
 The idea to use transplants of dopamine-producing cells to substitute for the lost midbrain dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) goes back to the 1970s. 
 Numerous scales assess dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD), variably focusing on anatomical distribution, phenomenology, time, severity, and disability. 
Although l-dopa-induced dyskinesias in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency are phenomenologically similar to those that occur in Parkinson's disease, they are different in a number of other respects, suggesting intrinsic differences in the pathophysiologic basis of l-dopa-induced dyskinesias in the 2 conditions. 
 The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5HT]) system has recently emerged as an important player in the appearance of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa [l-dopa])-induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

 Hypersexuality with compulsive sexual behaviour is a significant source of morbidity for patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopamine replacement therapies. 
We know relatively little about the pathophysiology of hypersexuality in Parkinson's disease, and it is unknown how visual sexual stimuli, similar to the portrayals of sexuality in the mainstream mass media may affect the brain and behaviour in such susceptible individuals. 
Here, we have studied a group of 12 patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality using a functional magnetic resonance imaging block design exposing participants to both sexual, other reward-related and neutral visual cues. 
We hypothesized that exposure to visual sexual cues would trigger increased sexual desire in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality that would correspond to changes in brain activity in regions linked to dopaminergically stimulated sexual motivation. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were scanned ON and OFF dopamine drugs, and their results were compared with a group of 12 Parkinson's disease control patients without hypersexuality or other impulse control disorders. 
Exposure to sexual cues significantly increased sexual desire and hedonic responses in the Parkinson's disease hypersexuality group compared with the Parkinson's disease control patients. 
When the patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were OFF medication, the functional imaging data showed decreases in activation during the presentation of sexual cues relative to rest. 
Stimulation through exposure to sexual visual cues in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality provides a motivational impetus for seeking this reward behaviour through activations and deactivations of cerebral cortex. 
Our data provide evidence that intrapallidal injection of 6-OHDA resulted in motor deficits paralleled by changes in the firing activity of STN and SNr neurons, which mimic in large part those obtained after major dopamine depletion in the classical rat model of Parkinson's disease.

 Animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely used to investigate the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder which is typically associated with the specific and largely disordered protein α-synuclein (α-syn). 
In contrast, using ELISA, high levels of serum autoantibodies to α-syn monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar conformers as well as DA were observed in both treatment groups reflecting immune system activation and this substantiates previous clinical studies in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from severe motor symptoms which can only be partly alleviated by means of dopaminergic medication. 
Three gene transfer paradigms for Parkinson's disease have been explored: converting L-dopa into dopamine through AADC gene delivery in the putamen; synthesizing GABA through GAD gene delivery in the overactive subthalamic nucleus and providing neurotrophic support through neurturin gene delivery in the nigro-striatal pathway. 
 We recently found severe noradrenaline deficits throughout the thalamus of patients with Parkinson's disease [C. 
As this noradrenaline loss was especially severe in nuclei of the motor thalamus normally transmitting basal ganglia motor output to the cortex, we hypothesized that this noradrenaline loss aggravates the motor disorder of Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that in the MPTP primate model, loss of noradrenaline in the motor thalamus may also contribute to the clinical expression of the parkinsonian motor disorder, corroborating experimentally our hypothesis on the role of thalamic noradrenaline deficit in Parkinson's disease. 
 Prolonged l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) administration, the gold standard therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with serious motor complications, known as l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID).

 Delivery of exogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) increases locomotor activity in rodent models of aging and Parkinson's disease in conjunction with increased dopamine (DA) tissue content in substantia nigra (SN). 
Given that theophylline showed less potency and efficacy than caffeine to reverse the motor impairment caused by chronic, but not acute, interruption of striatal dopaminergic transmission in rats, it is suggested that caffeine would provide more benefits than theophylline to improve the motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Physical exercise has been proven to improve gait and locomotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease; we sought to elucidate the effects of physical exercise on PLS induced by chronic administration of haloperidol in rats. 
In phase I clinical trials, GDNF treatment in Parkinson's disease patients led to improved motor function and GDNF has been found to be down regulated in Parkinson's disease patients. 
Consequently, dopamine-regulating drugs are effectively used in treating these disorders, such as L-DOPA for Parkinson's disease, methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or antipsychotics for schizophrenia. 
CONCLUSIONS: A single kinase, CK2, in D1-MSNs significantly alters dopamine signaling, a finding that could have therapeutic implications for disorders characterized by dopamine imbalance such as Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. 
As epidemiological and laboratory studies have suggested PCBs as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), the similarities between PBDEs and PCBs suggest that PBDEs have the potential to be neurotoxic to the dopamine system. 
Earlier studies showed how the strengthening of dopamine-modulated coupling may lead to transitions from non-synchronized to partially synchronized dynamics, typical in Parkinson's disease. 
The intermittent nature of the neural beta band synchrony in Parkinson's disease is achieved in the model due to the interplay of the timing of STN input to pallidum and pallidal neuronal dynamics, resulting in sensitivity of pallidal output to the phase of the arriving STN input. 
Thus the mechanism considered here (the change in firing pattern of subthalamic neurons through the dopamine-induced change of membrane properties) may be one of the potential mechanisms responsible for the generation of the intermittent synchronization observed in Parkinson's disease.

The hypothesis is based on the results of electromyographic (EMG) study using cutaneous electrodes in patients with tremor-rigid form of Parkinson's disease before and after the stereotaxic surgery. 
This mechanism does not work in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the deficit of brain dopamine that affects the control over static gamma-motoneurons. 
 Mutations in the PINK1 gene cause autosomal recessive familial Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The accurate management of dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson's disease is able to delay the appearance of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. 
Likewise, new evidences have shown that the earlier introduction of rasagiline is associated with a delay in introducing other dopaminergic drugs, thus indicating that the symptomatic benefit of rasagiline on daily motor function is not only present in the early Parkinson's disease stages, but is maintained over time. 
Hence, these nootropic agents may be considered as possible candidates in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 Cellular electrophysiological signatures of Parkinson's disease described in the pharmacological 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) animal models of Parkinson's disease include spontaneous repetitive giant GABAergic currents in a subpopulation of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and spontaneous rhythmic bursts of spikes generated by subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. 
We investigated whether similar signatures are present in Pink1(-/-) mice, a genetic rodent model of the PARK6 variant of Parkinson's disease. 
Although 9- to 24-month-old Pink1(-/-) mice show reduced striatal dopamine content and release, and impaired spontaneous locomotion, the relevance of this model to Parkinson's disease has been questioned because mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons do not degenerate during the mouse lifespan. 
However, several aspects remain unclear regarding the effects and the accuracy of rotenone as an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Restorative/protective therapies to restore dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) are greatly needed to effectively change the debilitating course of Parkinson's disease. 
These data demonstrate that allopregnanolone promotes the restoration of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons and total cells in the nigrostriatal tract, improves the motor performance in MPTP-treated mice, and may serve as a therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease. 
 Previous studies showed that tyrosine hydroxylase or neurturin gene-modified cells transplanted into rats with Parkinson's disease significantly improved behavior and increased striatal dopamine content. 
In the present study, we transplanted tyrosine hydroxylase and neurturin gene-modified bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the damaged striatum of Parkinson's disease model rats. 
These results indicate that transplantation of tyrosine hydroxylase and neurturin gene-modified bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells increases dopamine synthesis and significantly improves the behavior of rats with Parkinson's disease. 
 A cell-based therapy for the replacement of dopaminergic neurons has been a long-term goal in Parkinson's disease research.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a considerable socioeconomic burden. 
 Bladder dysfunctions are quite common in Parkinson's disease. 
 The current clinical trials of gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) are based on three strategies. 
 Dopamine transporter imaging is typically abnormal in Parkinson's disease and shows reduced striatal uptake, which is typically greater contralateral to the clinically more affected side. 
However, tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients may have significantly lower uptake in the striatum ipsilateral to the rest-tremor compared to akinetic-rigid PD patients, implying a possible role of an ipsilateral deficit in the generation of rest-tremor.We report here three patients with rest-tremor and the unexpected finding of an ipsilateral presynaptic dopaminergic deficit with normal uptake contralateral to the rest-tremor in dopamine transporter imaging. 
 L-dopa is a precursor for dopamine synthesis and a mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 Human pluripotent stem cells provide new choices for sources of A9-type dopaminergic (DA) neurons in clinical trials of neural transplantation for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The goal of developing a renewable source of human midbrain dopamine neurons was prompted by the pioneering studies on the use of human fetal dopamine neurons as an experimental therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
More recently, dopamine neurons have also turned into an important tool for modeling of Parkinson's disease in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell lines. 
We have found that a subset of neurons within embryonic neural grafts that survive more than 10 years in Parkinson patients display Lewy bodies, a classical feature of Parkinson's disease neuropathology. 
Additionally, the grafted cells placed in the Parkinson's disease brain eventually downregulate the expression of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase in a manner similar to what is seen in the substantia nigra dopamine neurons that are degenerating due to the disease. 
We discuss these findings in terms of how they might improve our understanding of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and the effects they may have on the future of neural cell replacement strategies.

 BACKGROUND: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an efficient target for treating patients with Parkinson's disease as well as patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using high frequency stimulation (HFS). 
In both Parkinson's disease and OCD patients, STN-HFS can trigger abnormal behaviours, such as hypomania and impulsivity.

Differentiating DIP from Parkinson's disease (PD) may be a challenge to clinicians. 
 BACKGROUND: Bradykinesia is a cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
L-DOPA is a famous treatment for Parkinson's disease symptoms. 
 Abnormal involuntary movement (AIM) rating scales are frequently used to study the mechanisms underlying L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in 6-OHDA lesioned rodents and the propensity of novel treatments for Parkinson's disease to induce or alleviate similar abnormal behaviours. 
Novel flavagline derivatives were synthesized and examined for their cytotoxicity on a panel of human cancer cell lines, their cardioprotection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and their neuroprotection in culture models of Parkinson's disease and cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. 
However, it is a great challenge to induce BMSCs to specifically differentiate to dopamine (DA) neurons for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Taking together, our results suggest that striatal extracts can specifically promote the dopaminergic differentiation of GFP-BMSCs, thereby providing a feasible strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Current diagnostic modalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) are limited by the fact that they identify PD by the presence of motor symptoms; by this point, over 60 percent of all dopamine neurons within specific regions of the basal ganglia may have been lost. 
 The pathogenic mechanisms that underlie Parkinson's disease remain unknown. 
Here, we review evidence from both sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease that implicate both mitochondria and oxidative stress as central players in disease pathogenesis.

Since a range of immunotherapies have recently been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease (PD), we investigated the effects of an IVIg treatment in a neurotoxin-induced animal model of PD. 
 Cell replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease has predominantly focused on ectopic transplantation of fetal dopamine (DA) neurons into the striatum as a means to restore neurotransmission, rather than homotopic grafts into the site of cell loss, which would require extensive axonal growth. 
Together, these findings suggest there is significant scope for further development of intra-nigral grafting as a restorative approach for Parkinson's disease. 
 The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution and the degree of asymmetric putaminal dopamine transporter availability in right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease and its association with the severity of lateralized motor signs. 
Asymmetry of motor symptoms was defined by the difference between right- and left-sided scores for lateralized items assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Score in a series of 68 patients with Parkinson's disease (disease duration 2.1 ± 1.5 years; Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Score 22.7 ± 9). 
We found that in the right-handed Parkinson's disease cohort, the number of patients who had lower dopamine transporter uptake in the left posterior putamen was significantly greater compared with those with lower uptake in the right posterior putamen (Parkinson's disease-left group, n = 49; Parkinson's disease-right group, n = 19; P < 0.001). 
In addition, one-way analysis of variance revealed significant reductions of mean total putaminal [(123)I]β-CIT binding of the Parkinson's disease-right patients compared with Parkinson's disease-left patients (P < 0.05).The preponderance of reduced left putaminal dopamine transporter availability strengthens clinical observations of a greater proportion of right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease with predominantly right-sided motor signs and argues against a randomly distributed asymmetric vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. 
The coexistence of a subgroup of right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease with more severe and predominant ipsilateral putaminal dopamine transporter decline suggests that asymmetry of dopaminergic denervation and motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease cannot be fully explained by hemispheric dominance alone, but that other factors must be involved. 
 L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), a detrimental consequence of dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease, is associated with an alteration in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and glutamate receptor interactions. 
We investigated possible seasonal changes in dopamine synthesis capacity in a relatively large sample of Parkinson's disease patients.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by decreased levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in the striatum of the brain, as a result of degeneration of DA neurons. 
These results suggest that limb motor function may be more sensitive to striatal dopaminergic depletion than cranial motor function and is consistent with the clinical observation that therapies targeting the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease are more effective for limb motor symptoms than cranial motor impairments. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease where environmental factors act on genetically predisposed individuals. 
 α-Synuclein is implicated both in physiological functions at neuronal synaptic terminals as well as in pathological processes in the context of Parkinson's disease. 
Common variants in the aSynL 3' untranslated region associated with Parkinson's disease risk promote the accumulation and translation of aSynL transcripts. 
We demonstrate that the presence of the extended aSynL transcript 3' untranslated region impacts accumulation of α-synuclein protein, which appears redirected away from synaptic terminals and towards mitochondria, reminiscent of Parkinson's disease pathology. 
Taken together, these findings identify a novel mechanism for aSyn regulation in the context of Parkinson's disease-associated genetic and environmental variations. 
 Usually, levodopa-induced dyskinesia does not remain unchanged throughout the day in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and varies according to the level of correction of PD symptomatology provided by the treatment. 
 L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are abnormal involuntary movements that develop with long term L-dopa therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
These data suggest that nicotine treatment would most effectively reduce LIDs in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. 
 The pattern of dopamine cell loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to be prominent in the ventrolateral and caudal substantia nigra (SN), but less severe in the dorsal and rostral region. 
 Although genes, protein aggregates, environmental toxins, and other factors associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) are widely distributed in the nervous system and affect many classes of neurons, a consistent feature of PD is the exceptional and selective vulnerability of dopamine (DA) neurons of the SNc. 
 It has been previously well established that the use of dopaminergic agents in Parkinson's disease may contribute to behavioral disturbances such as dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), impulse control disorders (ICD), and punding.

 INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with dopamine depletion in the fronto-striatal network which affects some language aspects such as verb processing. 
 BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms are very common among patients with Parkinson's disease since the earliest stage, but little is known about their progression and their relationship with dopaminergic replacement therapy.

Twenty patients with Parkinson's disease (10 homozygous for Val/Val and 10 for Met/Met catechol-O-methyltransferase polymorphisms) underwent (18)F-DOPA positron emission tomography using a prolonged imaging protocol. 
Late scan mean frontal and striatal Ki values were significantly reduced in both Parkinson's disease groups relative to early scan Ki values.

 In addition to its cardinal symptoms of bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, resting tremor and postural disturbances, Parkinson's disease (PD) also affects orolingual motor function. 
 Freezing of gait is an episodic gait disorder that may occur in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
To determine the relevant risk factors for this condition, we screened 160 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease for freezing of gait and assessed 36 potentially related variables.

Symptoms of depression emerge together with novel impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease has been traditionally thought of as a dopaminergic disease in which cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) die. 
However, accumulating evidence implies an important role for the serotonergic system in Parkinson's disease in general and in physiological responses to levodopa therapy, the first line of treatment.

 A high percentage of patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from depression in addition to their motor disabilities. 
However, the etiology of this depression and its relation to Parkinson's disease are unknown. 
Within the framework of the monoamine deficiency hypothesis of depression, we propose that the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are coupled by the lateral habenula, and argue that altered basal ganglia activity leads to lateral habenula hyperactivity, which in turn down-regulates the serotonergic system, resulting in depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We tested this hypothesis using the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine hemiparkinsonian rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings provide a plausible link between Parkinson's disease and depression and open up avenues for new therapeutic interventions in depression and possibly in Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopaminergic cell loss; however, the noradrenergic system exhibits degeneration as well. 
In light of evidence for prominent CM/PF neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease, we propose that the significant CM-striatal system degeneration, combined with the severe nigrostriatal dopamine loss in sensorimotor striatal regions, may alter normal automatic actions, and shift the processing of basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor programs towards goal-directed behaviors. 
 Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) consists of a series of complications such as compulsive use of dopaminergic medications, aggressive or hypomanic behaviors during excessive use, and withdrawal states characterized by dysphoria and anxiety, caused by long-term dopaminergic treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

The present results support targeting serotonin transporters to improve Parkinson's disease treatment and provide further evidence for the role of the serotonin system in l-DOPA's effects. 
 L-DOPA, the most effective drug to treat motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, causes abnormal involuntary movements, limiting its use in advanced stages of the disease. 
 Graft-induced dyskinesia (GID), covering a range of dystonic and choreiform involuntary movements, has been observed in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after intracerebral cell transplantation. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). 
 Dyskinesia, a major complication of treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), involves two phases: induction, which is responsible for dyskinesia onset, and expression, which underlies its clinical manifestation. 
 Over the last two decades, significant strides has been made toward acquiring a better knowledge of both the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Many patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease experience difficulties maintaining daytime alertness. 
Deficits in objectively assessed daytime alertness in Parkinson's disease appear to be a function of both the disease and the medications and their doses used. 
The apparent divergent dose-dependent effects of drug class in Parkinson's disease are anticipated by basic science studies of the sleep/wake cycle under different pharmacological agents. 
 This study investigated the contribution of the new G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) in neuroprotection by 17β-estradiol in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVES: Recently, 9-[(18)F]fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine ((18)F-AV-133) was reported as a new vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) imaging agent for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Sleep-wake disturbances are frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease, but prospective controlled electrophysiological studies of sleep in those patients are surprisingly sparse, and the pathophysiology of sleep-wake disturbances in Parkinson's disease remains largely elusive. 
In particular, the impact of impaired dopaminergic and hypocretin (orexin) signalling on sleep and wakefulness in Parkinson's disease is still unknown. 
We performed a prospective, controlled electrophysiological study in patients with early and advanced Parkinson's disease, e.g. 
This suggests that dopamine and hypocretin deficiency differentially affect sleep and wakefulness in Parkinson's disease. 
Despite hypocretin cell loss in Parkinson's disease being only partial, disturbed hypocretin signalling is likely to contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson patients. 
 The existing treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is directed towards substituting dopamine loss with either dopamine replacement therapy or pharmacological therapies aimed at increasing dopamine at the synapse level. 
 Dysfunctions of dopaminergic homeostasis leading to either low or high dopamine (DA) levels are causally linked to Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and addiction. 
Age-associated increases in 7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanine (oxo(8)dG) have been reported in brain regions and neuronal populations affected in Parkinson's disease (PD), toxin-induced parkinsonian models, and mice harboring genetic abnormalities associated with PD. 
 Intrastriatal transplantation of dopaminergic carotid body (CB) cells ameliorates parkinsonism in animal models and, with less efficacy, in Parkinson's disease patients. 
It should also help to improve cell therapy approaches to Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Many patients with Parkinson's disease have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 
We aimed to assess brain responses during a working memory task in a cohort of newly diagnosed drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease with and without MCI. 
METHODS: Participants were recruited within a prospective cohort study of incident patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease. 
Included patients fulfilled the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease. 
FINDINGS: Compared with controls (n=24), patients with Parkinson's disease (n=77) had under-recruitment in an extensive brain network including bilateral striatal and frontal regions (p<0·001). 
Within the Parkinson's disease group, patients with Parkinson's disease and MCI (n=30) had additional under-recruitment in the right dorsal caudate nucleus (p=0·005) and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (p<0·001) compared with patients with Parkinson's disease without MCI (n=26). 
In patients with Parkinson's disease and MCI, SPECT uptake in the right caudate was lower than in patients with Parkinson's disease without MCI (p=0·008) and correlated with striatal functional MRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal (r=0·32, p=0·031). 
INTERPRETATION: These altered brain responses in patients with Parkinson's disease and MCI suggest that cognitive impairment is linked to frontostriatal dysfunction. 
 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess striatal dopamine transporter availability in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) before and after 13 months of unilateral extradural motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) with [123I]N-ω-fluoropropyl-2-β-carbo-methoxy-3-β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane single photon emission computed tomography (123I-FP-CIT SPECT).

 BACKGROUND: Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) are amongst the most disabling side-effects of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), akinesia, rigidity and tremor, are only observed when the striatal level of dopamine (DA) is decreased by 60-80%. 
 Improvements in modelling Parkinson's disease in rodents contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge and open innumerable pathways for the development of new therapeutic interventions. 
In a recent article in this journal, Decressac and co-workers present an interesting comparison between two classic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) models and the more recently established rodent model of Parkinson's disease induced by over-expression of α-synuclein using adeno-associated viral vectors. 
 Pramipexole (PPX) is a dopamine agonist that is FDA-approved for treatment of motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. 
Regardless of this clinical picture, the capacity of PPX to regulate reward-mediated behaviors remains unclear and has not been evaluated in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
To model Parkinson's disease, the neurotoxin 6-OHDA was injected bilaterally into the dorsolateral striatum. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the nigrostriatal system. 
 Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are considered central in dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The present results indicate that adult skeletal muscle-derived stem cells could provide a promising cell source for autologous transplantation for neurodegenerative diseases in the future, especially the Parkinson's disease. 
 Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is the one of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and occurs in nearly every patient afflicted with this common neurodegenerative disorder. 
 Foetal cell transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease can induce motor complications independent of L-DOPA administration, known as graft-induced dyskinesia. 
In the 6-OHDA lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease, post-transplantation abnormal movements can develop in response to an amphetamine challenge, a behaviour which is used to model graft-induced dyskinesia. 
Although present in mild forms in some healthy people, it is a pathological state in conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease where it can have profoundly devastating effects. 
 Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist that is used frequently as a single therapy or in combination for the management of Parkinson's disease. 
 The progressive loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is a distinguishing feature of Parkinson's disease. 
As terminal field loss seems to precede cell body loss, we tested whether alterations of axonal transport motor proteins would be early features in Parkinson's disease. 
There was a decline in axonal transport motor proteins in sporadic Parkinson's disease that preceded other well-known nigral cell-related pathology such as phenotypic downregulation of dopamine. 
Reductions in conventional kinesin levels precede the alterations in dopaminergic phenotypic markers (tyrosine hydroxylase) in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
Unlike conventional kinesin, reductions in the levels of the cytoplasmic dynein light chain Tctex type 3 subunit were only observed at late Parkinson's disease stages. 
Reductions in levels of conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein subunits were recapitulated in a rat genetic Parkinson's disease model based on over-expression of human mutant α-synuclein (A30P). 
Together, our data suggest that α-synuclein aggregation is a key feature associated with reductions of axonal transport motor proteins in Parkinson's disease and support the hypothesis that dopaminergic neurodegeneration following a 'dying-back' pattern involving axonal transport disruption. 
 Several studies have successfully employed GM1 ganglioside to treat animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting involvement of this ganglioside in PD etiology. 
 OBJECTIVES: The pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) is often challenging as clinicians have to find a favourable balance between the efficacy on motor symptoms and side effect profiles of different dopaminergic medications. 
 The goal of researchers and clinicians interested in re-instituting cell based therapies for PD is to develop an effective and safe surgical approach to replace dopamine (DA) in individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Dysfunctions of its regulation are implicated in a broad range of behaviors and disorders including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug abuse. 
In this report the effects of dimebon as a neuroprotectant in animal models of Parkinson's disease were tested as assessed in methamphetamine- and MPTP-induced striatal dopaminergic toxicity. 
 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication of mice is a standard model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This process, known to rely on dopaminergic activity in striatal brain regions, is compromised in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
It is assumed that striatal dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease (PD) only affects the voluntary saccadic system and that the often-reported facilitation of the reflexive saccadic system in PD is secondary to impairment of the voluntary saccadic system. 
 In Parkinson's disease, one of the most troublesome dilemmas is the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. 
On the other hand, there are profound changes in CB(1) receptor cannabinoid signaling in the basal ganglia circuits after dopamine depletion (as happens in Parkinson's disease) and following l-DOPA replacement therapy. 
Monoamine homeostasis is highly regulated and dysfunction may play a role in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, drug addiction, and neuropsychiatric disorders. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive and profound loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to the formation of eosinophillic, intracytoplamic, proteinacious inclusions termed as lewy bodies. 
The present review attempts to narrate the multiple receptor interaction of DAs followed by the assessment of their side effects during the treatment of PD and possible remedial strategy for selective targeting of dopamine receptors to overcome these affects in therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and methamphetamine (MA), two commonly used neurotoxins in rodent models of Parkinson's disease, were administered to wild-type (Dyn⁺/⁺) and prodynorphin-deficient mice (Dyn⁻/⁻). 
 There have been a number of exciting developments in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the past decade. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines currently available therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease, emphasizing evidence-based data as well as a patient-centered approach to the treatment of motor and nonmotor symptoms. 
RECENT FINDINGS: Although clinical trials of disease-modifying approaches have been thus far disappointing, steady advances are being made in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In this review, we focus on recent studies with monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors (selegiline and rasagiline), coenzyme Q10, creatine, and exercise in early Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, we review recent studies of surgical treatments of Parkinson's disease, such as deep brain stimulation. 
SUMMARY: Numerous clinical trials have provided evidence that health-related quality of life can be substantially improved with early diagnosis and institution of exercise and other physical measures, appropriate timing of dopaminergic therapy, and strategies to delay and treat levodopa-related motor complications and nonmotor Parkinson's disease-related symptoms. 
 Olfactory dysfunction often precedes other clinical symptoms in chronic neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
 L-dopa is the most effective, currently available treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but it leads to the development of involuntary movements known as L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in the majority of patients after long-term use. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the accelerated death of dopamine (DA) producing neurons. 
 A 55-year-old male with idiopathic Parkinson's disease developed three behavioral changes under combination therapy with selegiline, cabergoline and levodopa. 
Brain [(18)F]fluorodopa PET imaging showed decreased tracer uptake in the striatum contralateral to the predominant motor symptoms, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
The patient was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease together with DSM-IV criteria-fulfilling pathological gambling and punding-like stereotyped behavior. 
Inspired by the case, we conducted a preliminary survey - including 290 patients with Parkinson's disease - exploring the possible relationship between creativity and impulsive-compulsive behaviors. 
The case, supported by the results of the survey, adds to the cumulative evidence of the association between dopaminergic medication and enhanced creativity, and suggests a possible linkage between increased artistic creativity and impulsive-compulsive behaviors in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed when striatal dopamine (DA) loss exceeds a certain threshold and the cardinal motor features become apparent. 
In Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic treatment produces a discontinuous stimulation, inducing an intermittent pulsatile activation of the striatal receptors. 
 Therapeutic strategies for essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) can be divided into two successive steps, one based on oral medications and the other, more invasive, using pumps or functional neurosurgery.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons and the presence of Lewy bodies. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), alteration of dopamine- (DA-) dependent striatal functions and pulsatile stimulation of DA receptors caused by the discontinuous administration of levodopa (L-DOPA) lead to a complex cascade of events affecting the postsynaptic striatal neurons that might account for the appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID).

 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to dopamine depletion in the striatum. 
Mutations in the PINK1 gene cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease. 
Loss of PINK1 function causes mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species production and calcium dysregulation, which increases susceptibility to neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. 
The basis of neuronal vulnerability to dopamine in Parkinson's disease is not well understood. 
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the mechanism of dopamine toxicity in PINK1 deficient neurons, and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease. 
 We have previously shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) perseverate in their choice of action relative to healthy controls, and that this is affected by dopaminergic medication (Hughes LE, Barker RA, Owen AM, Rowe JB. 
Parkinson's disease and healthy aging: Independent and interacting effects on action selection. 
 Convergent evidence indicates that raphestriatal serotonin (5-HT) neurons can convert and release dopamine (DA) derived from exogenous administration of the pharmacotherapeutic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (L-DOPA) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Previous studies have shown it to be covalently modified and potently inhibited by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), an endogenous neurotoxin via dopamine catabolism which is relevant to Parkinson's disease. 
The enzyme produced with this procedure can be used to delineate the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition by DOPAL and its relationship to Parkinson's disease. 
 Impairments in the capacity of dopaminergic neurons to handle cytoplasmic dopamine may be a critical factor underlying the selective vulnerability of midbrain dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Zonisamide has been proven as an effective drug for the recovery of degenerating dopaminergic neurons in the animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
However, several lines of evidence have questioned the neuroprotective capacity of zonisamide in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
The current study demonstrates the effects of zonisamide on astrocyte cultures and two 6-hydroxydopamine-induced models of Parkinson's disease. 
Taken together, these studies demonstrate that zonisamide protected dopamine neurons in two Parkinson's disease models through a novel mechanism, namely increasing the expression of some important astrocyte-mediated neurotrophic and anti-oxidative factors. 
 BACKGROUND: Despite optimum medical management, many patients with Parkinson's disease are incapacitated by gait disorders including freezing of gait. 
We aimed to assess whether methylphenidate--through its combined action on dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake--would improve gait disorders and freezing of gate in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease without dementia who also received subthalamic nucleus stimulation. 
Eligible patients were younger than 80 years and had Parkinson's disease, severe gait disorders, and freezing of gate despite optimised treatment of motor fluctuations with dopaminergic drugs and subthalamic stimulation. 
INTERPRETATION: Methylphenidate improved gait hypokinesia and freezing in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease receiving subthalamic nucleus stimulation. 
Methylphenidate represents a therapeutic option in the treatment of gait disorders at the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease.

 Studies on patients with Parkinson's disease and in animal models have observed enhanced synchronization of oscillations in several frequency bands within and between the cortical-basal ganglia (BG) structures. 
Findings indicate a crucial rule for dopamine in the regulation of HVS activity in the whole cortical-BG circuit, and suggest a close relationship between abnormally synchronized HVS oscillations in the cortex-BG network and Parkinson's disease. 
In VP the DAT-scan proved normal dopamine content of the striatum in contrast with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Plasticity of primary motor cortex is severely impaired in Parkinson's disease and chronic dopaminergic treatment is reported not to rescue it. 
In this study, it was hypothesized that cortical plasticity would be restored in Parkinson's disease as a long duration response to treatment in stable responders while those with motor complications would have a reduction or loss of plasticity similar to the decay of long duration response of motor signs. 
 Gastrointestinal disorders, constipation in particular, are the most common non-motor dysfunctions affecting Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

A hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal tract and is accompanied with loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine (DA). 
 Parkinson's disease is a major age-related neurodegenerative disorder. 
As the classical disease-related motor symptoms are associated with the loss of dopamine-generating cells within the substantia nigra, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines has become an important target in the development of Parkinson's disease drug candidates, with the focus to augment TH levels or its activity. 
The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is largely due to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, with a decrease in TH activity, TH synthesis and TH mRNA in the striatum of PD and animal experimental models. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease primarily characterised by motor symptoms. 
 Several studies have suggested an interaction between α-synuclein protein and iron in Parkinson's disease. 
The presence of iron together with α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, the increase of iron in the substantia nigra and the correlation between polymorphism of the several genes implicated in iron metabolism and Parkinson's disease, support a role for iron in the neurodegeneration. 
Analysis of post mortem brains revealed increased amount of insoluble α-synuclein protein despite unchanged/reduced levels of α-synuclein mRNA in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with characteristic motor manifestations.

 L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias are a serious side effect that develops in most Parkinson's disease patients on dopamine replacement therapy. 
To conclude, the similar declines in L-dopa-induced AIMs in nicotine-treated wildtype mice and in α6⁻/⁻ mice treated with and without nicotine indicate an essential role for α6β2* nAChRs in the maintenance of L-dopa-induced AIMs.These findings suggest that α6β2* nAChR drugs have potential for reducing L-dopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. 
 Dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by loss of acetylcholine (ACh) from cortical areas.

 Although patients with Parkinson's disease show impairments in cognitive performance even at the early stage of the disease, the synaptic mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in this pathology are unknown. 
We found that hippocampal long-term potentiation is altered in both a neurotoxic and transgenic model of Parkinson's disease and this plastic alteration is associated with an impaired dopaminergic transmission and a decrease of NR2A/NR2B subunit ratio in synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors. 
Interestingly, the dopamine precursor l-DOPA was able to restore hippocampal synaptic potentiation via D1/D5 receptors and to ameliorate the cognitive deficit in parkinsonian animals suggesting that dopamine-dependent impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation may contribute to cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease.

 Cell transplantation is a strategy with great potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and many types of stem cells, including neural stem cells and embryonic stem cells, are considered candidates for transplantation therapy. 
They have trophic effects for protecting damaged tissues as well as differentiation ability to generate a broad spectrum of cells, including dopamine neurons, which contribute to the replenishment of lost cells in Parkinson's disease. 
This paper focuses mainly on the potential of mesenchymal stem cells as a therapeutic cell source and discusses their potential clinical application in Parkinson's disease. 
This topic is timely with respect to Parkinson's disease given recent data indicating changes in the striatal endocannabinoid system in patients with this disorder.

 The transplantation of dopamine rich foetal tissue into Parkinson's disease patients holds much promise as a therapeutic strategy. 
 Addictions to dopaminergic drugs or to pleasant behaviours are frequent and potentially devastating neuropsychiatric disorders observed in Parkinson's disease. 
We prospectively investigated behaviour in a cohort of 63 patients with Parkinson's disease, before and 1 year after subthalamic stimulation using the Ardouin scale, with systematic evaluation of functioning in overall appetitive or apathetic modes, non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, as well as behavioural addictions (including impulse control disorders and punding) and compulsive use of dopaminergic medication. 
We show an overall improvement in neuropsychiatric symptomatology and propose that disabling non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic treatment abuse and drug-induced behavioural addictions in Parkinson's disease may be considered as new indications for subthalamic stimulation. 
Here, we examined its precise contribution by exploiting the lesion deficit model afforded by Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) has a prodromal phase during which nonmotor clinical features as well as physiological abnormalities may be present.

 The diverse and independently-varying signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) are often attributed to one simple mechanism: degeneration of the dopaminergic innervation of the posterolateral striatum. 
 Dopamine agonists such as pramipexole (PPX) have first been proposed as adjunctive treatment to levodopa (L-DOPA) for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and then as a monotherapy alternative to alleviate dyskinesia. 
 INTRODUCTION: Current Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy is essentially symptomatic, and l-Dopa (LD), is the treatment of choice in more advanced stages of the disease.

We found that dopaminergic medication, consisting of levodopa and/or dopamine agonists taken at own dose, in 18 patients with mild Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr < 2.5) potentiated reward-based approach in terms of both accuracy and reaction times, while leaving punishment-based avoidance unaffected. 
Recently, studies have focused on investigating the therapeutic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a deficiency in motor cortex modulation due to degeneration of pigmented dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra projecting to the striatum. 
Insufficient dopamine level due to the loss of dopamine producing cells may lead to disease called Schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe loss of dopaminergic neurons and depletion of dopamine in substantia nigra. 
In Parkinson's disease, the cell type requiring replacement is dopamine-producing neurons of the midbrain. 
Differences have been noted in concentration and availability of this enzyme and its cofactors in disease states such as Parkinson's disease (PD) which are subject to alterations in catecholamines. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder in elderly people. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons leading to decrease in striatal dopamine (DA) levels. 
 Although researchers are pursuing "disease modifying" medications to slow or stop Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, a myriad of agents with protective properties in cell cultures and animal models have yielded few treatments in clinical practice. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or inadequate and impaired detoxification by endogenous antioxidants, alterations in catecholamine metabolism, alterations in mitochondrial electron transfer function, and enhanced iron deposition in the substantia nigra. 
 Classically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered to be a motor system affliction and its diagnosis is based on the presence of a set of cardinal motor signs (e.g. 
 The nigrostriatal pathway is very likely involved in sleep regulation, considering the occurrence and high prevalence of sleep-related disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease.

COMT inhibitors, that are adjunctive drugs in Parkinson's disease treatment, lower homocysteine levels and improve executive memory processes in normal subjects. 
COMT has attracted strong interest in regards to its role in dopamine-related pathologies, particularly Parkinson's disease. 
There are several mechanisms for the potential involvement of COMT-related processes in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease or the consequences of L-DOPA treatment. 
COMT inhibitors have a long history of clinical use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Here, we review the basic molecular mechanisms that could be involved in COMT-dependent processes in Parkinson's disease, the pharmacological properties of COMT inhibitors used in the treatment of this disorder and the clinical genetic observations involving COMT gene variants as modulators of pathological processes and responses to dopamine replacement therapies used in the treatment of the disorder.

 X-box-binding protein 1-transfected neural stem cells were transplanted into the right lateral ventricles of rats with rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that transplantation of X-box-binding protein 1-transfected neural stem cells can promote stem cell survival and differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, increase dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels, reduce α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra, and improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in rats. 
 Dopamine D3-preferring agonists are commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome; however, laboratory animal studies suggest that they may possess a moderate abuse potential. 
 INTRODUCTION: Rotigotine, a non-ergolinic dopamine-receptor agonist, is currently approved as monotherapy in early idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), in moderate to severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) and as adjunct therapy to levodopa in advanced IPD. 
In Parkinson's disease, synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses is altered. 
Thus the dependence on glutamate and dopamine balance of the corticostriatal synapse responsiveness validates the accuracy of this manageable in vitro model to depict the molecular pathways involved in the plasticity at corticostriatal synapses and to test restorative therapeutic approaches in Parkinson's disease. 
 Although the underlying cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well characterized, epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to agricultural chemicals is a risk factor for PD. 
 Major limitations to the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the motor complications resulting from L-DOPA treatment. 
 The present study examines the ability of melatonin to protect striatal dopaminergic loss induced by 6-OHDA in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, comparing the results with L-DOPA-treated rats. 
Thus, Melatonin is a useful treatment to delay the cellular and behavioral alterations observed in Parkinson's disease. 
 PURPOSE: We characterized the progression of dopamine transporter (DAT) decline in the striatum and extrastriatal regions including the midbrain and pons of patients with the Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and compared longitudinally collected SPECT results with those in a cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The development of radioligands for the dopaminergic system has provided suitable imaging biomarkers for clinical research in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related movement disorders. 
Like DLB, Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) also shares common features with DLB. 
 The central role of dopamine neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease provides a clear pathologic framework and rationale for imaging the system both to interrogate dynamic pathophysiologic changes as well as to aid in diagnosis and clinical management. 
This informs PET and SPECT evaluations for testing hypotheses regarding the course of degeneration in longitudinal studies of Parkinson's disease patients. 
 The dopamine system is involved in motivation, reward and learning, and dysfunction in this system has been implicated in several disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia. 
 In this paper, the protective effect of the bioflavonoid quercetin on behaviors, antioxidases, and neurotransmitters in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine-(MPTP-) induced Parkinson's disease (PD) was investigated. 
goldsteind@ninds.nih.gov  Central catecholamine deficiency characterizes α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. 
To test this hypothesis we measured cerebrospinal fluid levels of catechols including dopamine, norepinephrine and their main respective neuronal metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and dihydroxyphenylglycol in Parkinson's disease and two other synucleinopathies, multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure. 
Cerebrospinal fluid catechols were assayed in 146 subjects-108 synucleinopathy patients (34 Parkinson's disease, 54 multiple system atrophy, 20 pure autonomic failure) and 38 controls. 
The Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure groups all had lower cerebrospinal fluid dihydroxyphenylacetic acid [0.86 ± 0.09 (SEM), 1.00 ± 0.09, 1.32 ± 0.12 nmol/l] than controls (2.15 ± 0.18 nmol/l; P < 0.0001; P < 0.0001; P = 0.0002). 
Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was lower and dihydroxyphenylglycol higher in Parkinson's disease than in pure autonomic failure. 
Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was 100% sensitive at 89% specificity in separating patients with recent onset of parkinsonism from controls but was of no value in differentiating Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy. 
Parkinson's disease and pure autonomic failure involve differential dopaminergic versus noradrenergic lesions. 
Cerebrospinal fluid dihydroxyphenylacetic acid seems to provide a sensitive means to identify even early Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine toxicity is an ongoing controversy surrounding the use of levadopa (L-Dopa) in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Since the cytotoxicity of Z-ligustilide was not reported previously, the results of this study should raise public concerns over the potential risk associated with the combined use of herbal medicines containing Z-ligustilide with L-Dopa in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Long-term treatment with the dopamine precursor levodopa (l-DOPA) frequently induces dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease patients, which is a major complication of this therapy. 
Notably, parkinsonism disappears during RBD-associated complex behaviors in patients with Parkinson's disease and with multiple system atrophy, suggesting that the upper motor stream bypasses the basal ganglia during REM sleep. 
Longitudinal studies show that idiopathic RBD predisposes patients to later develop Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and, more rarely, multiple system atrophy, with a rate of conversion of 46% within 5 years. 
Patients with idiopathic RBD have higher and faster risk for conversion to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies if abnormalities in dopamine transporter imaging, transcranial sonography, olfaction, and color vision are found at baseline. 
 The capacity of sympathoadrenal progenitors from adrenal medulla to generate dopaminergic neurons in vitro makes them an attractive source for replacement therapies of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
lixinw@ucla.edu  BACKGROUND: Levodopa (L-dopa) is the most commonly used treatment for alleviating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Potential therapeutic benefits of ghrelin agonists in Parkinson's disease patients treated with L-dopa remain to be investigated. 
 Recently, it is under scrutiny the possibility to anticipate the stereotactic implantation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) even in relatively mild Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with an unsatisfying response to drugs. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from significant motor impairments and accompanying cognitive and affective dysfunction due to progressive disturbances of basal ganglia-cortical gating loops. 
Parkinson's disease has a long presymptomatic stage, which indicates a substantial capacity of the human brain to compensate for dopaminergic nerve degeneration before clinical manifestation of the disease. 
A breakdown of this compensatory mechanism might lead to the impairment of facial expressivity and facial emotion recognition observed in manifest Parkinson's disease. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) sometimes develop impulsive compulsive behaviours (ICBs) due to their dopaminergic medication. 
 Levodopa has an established position in the treatment of Parkinson's disease for the last 40 years. 
The treatment is relatively easy in the first uncomplicated stage of Parkinson's disease, but the results of many studies performed in recent years showed that the time of treatment initiation and the mode of initial treatment may influence the course of disease in following years. 
This review paper aims to show the recent views on treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa still being a core of this therapy. 
 During Parkinson's disease (PD), compensatory regeneration or sprouting of fibers from surviving dopaminergic neurons in the striatum occurs in response to the lesion in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). 
Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic disorder that can be seen as part of later stage Parkinson's disease and in multiple system atrophy, but is rarely seen in PSP. 
 The decrease of dopamine D₂/D₃ receptor densities in the putamen and nucleus caudatus goes parallel with maintained levels of CB₁ cannabinoid receptors in Parkinson's disease: a preliminary autoradiographic study with the selective dopamine D₂/D₃ antagonist [³H]raclopride and the novel CB₁ inverse agonist [¹²⁵I]SD7015. 
In the present study, we used human brain samples to examine the relationship between CB₁R and dopamine receptor density in case of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Increased risk of heart valve disease during treatment with certain dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, has been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists have been shown to provide neuroprotection in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
This study explored the impact of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone and the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 in the MPP(+)/MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model of Parkinson's disease, focussing on oxidative stress mechanisms. 
 PD (Parkinson's disease) is characterized by the selective loss of DA (dopaminergic) neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain region, but not in the ventral tegmental area and other catecholaminergic cell group areas. 
Not surprisingly then, it has been linked to a number of conditions including minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, epilepsy, addiction, cluster headache, essential tremor, and Parkinson's disease. 
 The neurotoxins methamphetamine (METH) and MPTP are well-known for their effects on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and use in modeling neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Several parameters related to the timing, grip force and load force involved in a precision grasping task were studied in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at different moments of medication and healthy controls, using a sensorized anthropomorphic device which was totally adapted to the human hand. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective and progressive degeneration, as well as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

 It has been shown that a decreased vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) function and the disruption of dopamine (DA) storage is an early contributor to oxidative damage of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Large increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) have been measured in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) following the administration of L-DOPA, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unknown. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We recently reported that broad spectrum agonist-induced activation of presynaptic group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors within the substantia nigra pars compacta using L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate provided functional neuroprotection in the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
In addition to the reported symptomatic effects, activation of mGlu(4) receptors may also offer a novel approach for slowing the progressive degeneration observed in Parkinson's disease. 
 Ongoing investigations into causes and cures for human movement disorders are important toward the elucidation of diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. 
 The development of radioligands for the dopaminergic system has provided suitable imaging biomarkers for clinical research in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related movement disorders. 
On the other hand, Parkinson's disease (which is known to decrease dopamine levels in both the striatum and cortex) produces proactive interference in the odd-man-out task (Flowers & Robertson, 1985) and renders subjects insensitive to negative feedback during reversal learning (Cools, Altamirano, & D'Esposito, 2006). 
 To study the neuroprotective effect of extract of Acanthopanax senticosus Harms against MPTP-induced mice model of Parkinson's disease and its mechanism. 
The Parkinson's disease mice model was induced by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Hydrochloride (MPTP-HCl, 30mg/kg daily for 5 days). 
In addition, the Parkinson's disease related gene parkin and the endocannabinoid system also participate in the regulation of reactive gliosis by estradiol. 
It has been reported as efficacious in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and restless legs syndrome. 
Because dopamine (DA) toxicity is well known to be involved in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, we tested in this study whether a relationship might exist between Sig-1Rs and DA-induced cytotoxicity in a cellular model by using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 
 Dopamine (DA) agonists are widely used as primary treatments for Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, we found that subcutaneous injection of a cytokine mixture containing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 (IL-3) markedly suppressed dopaminergic neurodegeneration in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
However, RAS hyperactivation also exacerbates NADPH-oxidase activity, oxidative stress and the microglial inflammatory response and contribute to progression of dopaminergic neuron loss, as observed in recent studies with animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Development of relevant models of Parkinson's disease (PD) is essential for a better understanding of the pathological processes underlying the human disease and for the evaluation of promising targets for therapeutic intervention. 
This study was conducted to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy after repeated oral administration of prolonged-release tablets of ropinirole hydrochloride in the absence of L-dopa preparations in Japanese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Previous studies have shown that pramipexole might have the potential to improve depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Our data indicate that pramipexole improves depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Dysregulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. 
Such agents may lead to the development of novel classes of drugs useful for the treatment of psychosis, drug abuse and Parkinson's disease. 
 Studies with the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) animal model of Parkinson's disease have shown the ability of 17β-estradiol to protect the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. 
 Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most typical characteristics in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (advanced stage). 
This article recapitulates the present understandings and concepts underlying the modulation of different receptors in human beings and various experimental models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as a conceptual update on the underlying mechanisms. 
Specific roles of serotonin, adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will be interactively discussed. 
The pathological alterations in the receptors would, therefore, contribute to cognitive impairments and/or deterioration in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Recent studies have pointed out the existence of verb impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder typically characterized by motor disturbance related to dopamine deficiency in the nigrostriatal system. 
 BACKGROUND: Abnormal somatosensory processing may contribute to motor impairments observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
METHODS: Somatosensory tactile perception was investigated using temporal order judgment in patients with Parkinson's disease on and off dopaminergic medications and in aged-matched healthy controls. 
 Dopa decarboxylase (DDC), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of dopamine and serotonin, is involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Previous studies have reported elevated levels of biogenic aldehydes in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Tremor in Parkinson's disease has several mysterious features. 
Clinically, tremor is seen in only three out of four patients with Parkinson's disease, and tremor-dominant patients generally follow a more benign disease course than non-tremor patients. 
Pathophysiologically, tremor is linked to altered activity in not one, but two distinct circuits: the basal ganglia, which are primarily affected by dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease, and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, which is also involved in many other tremors. 
The purpose of this review is to integrate these clinical and pathophysiological features of tremor in Parkinson's disease. 
We first describe clinical and pathological differences between tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtypes, and then summarize recent studies on the pathophysiology of tremor. 
Finally, we address several important open questions: why resting tremor stops during voluntary movements, why it has a variable response to dopaminergic treatment, why it indicates a benign Parkinson's disease subtype and why its expression decreases with disease progression. 
 OBJECTIVES: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have higher-order discriminative sensory dysfunction including prolonged somesthetic temporal discrimination threshold (sTDT). 
Our previous results showed that reduction in expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NR1), the key subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, by antisense oligos ameliorated the motor symptoms in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat, an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of dopamine transporters with (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 has recently been proposed to offer valuable information for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Accordingly, the broad variety of subtle oculomotor alterations that has been described in Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally attributed to the dysfunction of the BG dopaminergic system. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have remarkably reduced levels of dopaminergic biomarkers in the caudal putamen. 
Alendronate reduced the incidence of hip fractures in patients with Parkinson's disease, and risedronate reduced the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease or stroke. 
 Dopamine depletion in experimental models of Parkinson's disease promotes burst firing of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra zona reticulata (SNR). 
Dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of polysynaptic connections in the STN might be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Pain is an important and distressing symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Here we describe a MALDI IMS based approach for elucidating region-specific distribution profiles of neuropeptides in the rat brain of an animal model Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Therefore, we utilized MALDI IMS in an animal model of experimental Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA induced dyskinesia. 
 The unilaterally lesioned 6-hyroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) has proved to be invaluable in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying parkinsonian symptoms, since it recapitulates the changes in basal ganglia circuitry and pharmacology observed in parkinsonian patients(1-4). 
The functional consequences of the interactions between striatal adenosine A(2A), mGluR(5) and dopamine D(2) receptors on striatopallidal GABA release and motor behavior dysfunctions suggest the possibility of simultaneously targeting these receptors in Parkinson's disease treatment. 
 To investigate the putative interaction between chronic exposure to adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine and genetic influences on Parkinson's disease (PD), we determined whether deletion of the adenosine A(2A) receptor in knockout (KO) mice protects against dopaminergic neuron degeneration induced by a mutant human α-synuclein (hm(2)-αSYN) transgene containing both A53T and A30P. 
peter.riederer@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de  The destruction of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and consequent depletion of striatal dopamine elicits the main movement deficits related to Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Symptoms of Parkinson's disease typically emerge later in life when loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neuron function exceeds the threshold of compensatory mechanisms in the basal ganglia. 
Although nigrostriatal dopamine neurons are lost during aging, in Parkinson's disease other detrimental factors must play a role to produce greater than normal loss of these neurons. 
In addition, the data suggest that uncoupling protein-2 may be a target for retarding the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons that occurs in Parkinson's disease and aging. 
The findings are of translational relevance, because COMT inhibitors are used in the adjunctive treatment of Parkinson's disease and are under evaluation in schizophrenia and other disorders. 
We conclude that activation of EphA receptor-mediated signaling by clustered ephrin-A1-Fc from within the lateral ventricle could potentially be utilized in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
The familial forms of Parkinson's disease associated with multiplications of the α-syn gene locus indicate that overabundance of this protein might have a detrimental effect on dopaminergic transmission. 
Especially, 6'-O-trans-p-coumaroylgeniposide exhibited more selective MAO-B inhibition than deprenyl, well-known MAO-B inhibitor for the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease. 
 Depression is a frequent comorbid disorder in Parkinson's disease (PD) which may precede appearance of its motor symptoms by several years.

 Degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
The development of cell-replacement therapies for Parkinson's disease motor symptoms is hampered by poor acquisition and retention of the DA phenotype by endogenous and transplanted neurons.

 Treatment of Parkinson's disease with dopaminergic agents, such as l-DOPA, is frequently compromised by disabling side effects, particularly dyskinesia and a shortening in duration of antiparkinsonian action. 
Studies in animal models and anecdotal evidence from a patient with Parkinson's disease show that the illicit drug ecstasy (MDMA) can alleviate these side effects, though with many drawbacks (e.g., psychoactivity). 
These data identify a new class of therapeutic in Parkinson's disease and highlight the potential benefits of studying illicit drugs that in themselves would never be considered safe for long-term therapy. 
Major applications of PET for brain research have consisted of studies of animal models of neurological disorders, notably Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD), stroke, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury; these studies have particularly benefited from selective neurochemical lesion models (PD), and also transgenic rodent models (AD, HD).

 BACKGROUND: Changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) functionality have been implicated in Parkinson's disease. 
This study aimed to investigate BBB transport of L-DOPA transport in conjunction with its intra-brain conversion, in both control and diseased cerebral hemispheres in the unilateral rat rotenone model of Parkinson's disease. 
Ex-vivo brain tissue was analyzed for changes in tyrosine hydroxylase staining as a biomarker for Parkinson's disease severity. 
CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease-like pathology, indicated by a huge reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase as well as by substantially reduced levels and higher elimination rates of DOPAC and HVA, does not result in changes in BBB transport of L-DOPA. 
Taking the results of this study and that of previous ones, it can be concluded that changes in BBB functionality are not a specific characteristic of Parkinson's disease, and cannot account for the decreased benefit of L-DOPA at later stages of Parkinson's disease.

 This article reviews the role of an extended-release formulation of pramipexole in the treatment of Parkinson's disease at an early stage. 
Although levodopa is the current "gold standard" for treatment of Parkinson's disease, its effectiveness fades rapidly and its use results in serious motor fluctuations (on-off, wearing-off, freezing, involuntary movements) for most patients with the disease. 
Its preferential affinity for the D(3) receptor subtype could contribute to its efficacy in the treatment of both the motor and psychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
The best approach to medical management of early Parkinson's disease remains controversial. 
The current approach to treatment of early Parkinson's disease depends in part on individual patient factors, including age, severity and nature of symptoms and their impact, presence of cognitive dysfunction, possible underlying behavioral factors predisposing to impulse control disorders, and other comorbidities. 
Thus, a new "levodopa-sparing" paradigm for treating Parkinson's disease may now be possible, whereby patients are initially treated with pramipexole and levodopa is added only as necessary.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the association between different dopamine agonists and CVR in patients with Parkinson's disease or hyperprolactinaemia. 
DESIGN: Nested case-control studies conducted separately in cohorts of Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinaemia patients. 
The Parkinson's disease cohort included new users of dopamine agonists or levodopa, while the hyperprolactinaemia cohort included new users or non-users of dopamine agonists. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of newly diagnosed CVR with dopamine agonist use compared with levodopa use in the Parkinson's disease cohort, and dopamine agonist-naïve patients in the hyperprolactinaemia cohort. 
RESULTS: In the Parkinson's disease cohort (7893 dopamine agonist users, 11 766 levodopa users), 85 incident CVR cases were identified. 
CONCLUSION: Ergot-derived dopamine agonists are associated with an increased risk of CVR in Parkinson's disease but not in hyperprolactinaemia patients.

 Dopamine dysregulation syndrome is a complication of the dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease that may be very disabling due to the negative impact that compulsive medication use may have on patients' social, psychological, and physical functioning. 
The relationship between subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in patients with Parkinson's disease remains unclear. 
 Antagonists of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) were among the first treatments for Parkinson's disease. 
 Impulse control disorders and related disorders (hobbyism-punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome) occur in 15% to 20% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 Parkinson's disease and drug-induced movement disorders (DIMDs) have commonalities in etiology based on impaired dopamine-based neurotransmission. 
The A(2A) receptors' role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and DIMDs is evidenced by the upregulation of A(2A) receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease and patients receiving long-term administration of dopamine blockers. 
Further, A(2A)-receptor antagonists are effective in reversing parkinsonian motor deficits and extrapyramidal symptoms in animal models of Parkinson's disease and DIMDs. 
Understanding the role of A(2A)-receptor antagonism in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and DIMD has therapeutic implications. 
 Parkinson's disease is a disorder characterized pathologically by progressive neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic cells of the nigrostriatal pathway. 
Although the resulting dopamine deficiency is the cause of the typical motor features of Parkinson's disease (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor), additional non-motor symptoms appear at various timepoints and are the result of non-dopamine nerve degeneration. 
Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors are used in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease as they increase synaptic dopamine by blocking its degradation. 
Two MAO-B inhibitors, selegiline and rasagiline, are currently licensed in Europe and North America for the symptomatic improvement of early Parkinson's disease and to reduce off-time in patients with more advanced Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations related to levodopa. 
A third MAO-B inhibitor (safinamide), which also combines additional non-dopaminergic properties of potential benefit to Parkinson's disease, is currently under development in phase III clinical trials as adjuvant therapy to either a dopamine agonist or levodopa. 
There is considerable laboratory evidence that MAO-B inhibitors do exert some neuroprotective properties, at least in the Parkinson's disease models currently available.

 OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of Bushen Huoxue Decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicinal preparation, on dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in the brain of rat models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. 
 The aim of present study was to investigate the risk of heart failure associated with dopamine agonist use in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
A case control study nested within a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients who were new users of either dopamine agonist or levodopa was conducted. 
In the cohort of 25,459 Parkinson's disease patients (11,151 new users of dopamine agonists, 14,308 new users of levodopa), 518 incident heart failure cases were identified during follow-up. 
The results of this study indicate that ergot dopamine agonist use in Parkinson's disease patients was not associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed heart failure. 
 L-DOPA is the gold standard medication of Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder consequent upon the degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. 
 Recent studies suggest that l-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID), a severe complication of conventional L-DOPA therapy of Parkinson's disease, may be caused by dopamine (DA) release originating in serotonergic neurons. 
To evaluate the in vivo effect of a 5-HT(1A) agonist [(±)-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin hydrobromide, 8-OHDPAT] on the L-DOPA-induced increase in extracellular DA and decrease in [(11) C]raclopride binding in an animal model of advanced Parkinson's disease and LID, we measured extracellular DA in response to L-DOPA or a combination of L-DOPA and the 5-HT(1A) agonist, 8-OHDPAT, with microdialysis, and determined [(11) C]raclopride binding to DA receptors, with micro-positron emission tomography, as the surrogate marker of DA release. 
 Rotigotine transdermal patch (Neupro(®)) [referred to here as rotigotine] is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist that is available in the EU as monotherapy for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease and as combination therapy with levodopa throughout the course of the disease. 
In early Parkinson's disease, compared with placebo, rotigotine monotherapy produced significantly greater improvements in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale summed motor and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (primary endpoint), as well as significantly higher response rates. 
In advanced Parkinson's disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reduced 'off' time (primary endpoint) and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. 
Thus, rotigotine offers a novel approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, given its ease of administration, efficacy in reducing disabling motor and non-motor symptoms, and acceptable tolerability profile, it has the potential to be an attractive treatment option for this highly debilitating disease. 
 Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The risk of Parkinson's disease is reduced by cigarette smoking, which raises some unanswered questions. 
By contrast, in animal models of Parkinson's disease, nicotine alone has slight or no motor effects.

 BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) like compulsive gambling, buying, sexual, and eating behaviors in Parkinson's disease (PD) are debated. 
 BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease frequently suffer from impaired autonomic nervous function. 
To elucidate the effects of the induction of anesthesia with propofol on cardiovascular hemodynamics has become important, since the number of patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing deep brain stimulation under general anesthesia has increased recently. 
METHODS: Effects of induction with propofol in patients with Parkinson's disease on cardiovascular hemodynamics and autonomic nervous activity were compared with those of the control patients. 
Moreover, possible different effect on hemodynamics between the propofol alone and the combination of propofol and fentanyl for the induction were examined in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
RESULTS: Although heart rate or blood pressure was not different between patients with Parkinson's disease and the control patients before the induction, sympathetic vasomotor activity was lower in patients with Parkinson's disease than the control patients. 
The induction of anesthesia significantly decreased blood pressure in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
However the decreasing systolic blood pressure after the induction of anesthesia was more marked in patients with Parkinson's disease than the control patients. 
We did not find differences in the changes of blood pressure between the propofol alone and the combination of propofol and fentanyl in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: No abnormal responses to the induction of anesthesia with propofol were found in the patients with Parkinson's disease. 
To study this issue, the performance of treated/untreated patients with Parkinson's disease and controls was analysed in an implicit learning task, hypothesising dopamine-dependent adherence to hidden task rules. 
Since this is passive whenever selective actions are executed against an inactive background, dopaminergic treatment could in according scenarios contribute to passive behaviour in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I) belong to the earliest drugs tried in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dysfunctions of ubiquitin-proteasome system and toxicity of dopamine have been known as the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and proteasome inhibitors are widely used in experimental models of PD to reproduce cell death of dopaminergic neurons.

 Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computerized tomography can visualize dopaminergic degeneration in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. 
The present study compared patterns of striatal dopamine transporter distribution in postmortem-confirmed Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. 
Patients with a postmortem diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (n = 6) or Parkinson's disease (n = 8) who had undergone dopamine transporter imaging were included. 
Imaging had been performed after a mean disease duration of 3.6 and 4.1 years in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease, respectively. 
Mean overall striatal binding was reduced by 53% in multiple system atrophy and 52% in Parkinson's disease. 
There was a trend for greater asymmetry of striatal binding in multiple system atrophy compared with Parkinson's disease (23% ± 15% vs 10.5% ± 7%, respectively; P = .071), with 3 multiple system atrophy patients showing more asymmetry of striatal binding than any Parkinson's disease patient. 
This is the first study comparing dopamine transporter imaging in autopsy-confirmed multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease. 
Unexpectedly, we found a tendency for greater asymmetry of striatal binding in multiple system atrophy than in Parkinson's disease. 
Patients with malignancy, end-stage renal disease, neuropathy, history of spinal cord diseases, pregnancy and Parkinson's disease were excluded. 
 AIM: Oxidative stress has long been considered as a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
However, molecular sources for reactive oxygen species in Parkinson's disease have not been clearly elucidated.

 Clinical evidence suggests that after initiation of dopaminergic medications some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. 
The data also raise the possibility of using VAChT as a target to boost dopaminergic function and decrease high striatal cholinergic activity, common neurochemical alterations in individuals affected with Parkinson's disease. 
 Current gene therapy approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD) deliver neurotrophic factors like glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or neurturin via neuronal transgene expression.

Taken together, we conclude that Nrdp1 plays a role in neurodegeneration and could be potentially targeted as a therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.

We studied a cohort of 78 subjects (at baseline) with sporadic Parkinson's disease and 35 healthy controls with multi-tracer positron emission tomography scans to investigate the evolution of adaptive mechanisms influencing striatal dopamine processing in Parkinson's disease progression. 
The subjects with Parkinson's disease and the healthy controls underwent positron emission tomography scans at the initial visit and after 4 and 8 years of follow-up. 
We found evidence for possible upregulation of dopamine synthesis and downregulation of dopamine transporter in the more severely affected putamen in the early stage of Parkinson's disease. 
Our data suggest that compensatory mechanisms decline as Parkinson's disease progresses. 
 There are many indications that neurogenesis is impaired in Parkinson's disease, which might be due to a lack of dopamine in the subventricular zone. 
An impairment in neurogenesis may have negative consequences for the development of new therapeutic approaches in Parkinson's disease, as neural stem cells are a potential source for endogenous repair. 
In this study, we examined the subventricular zone of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 10 age- and sex-matched controls for proliferation and neural stem cell numbers. 
We also included five cases with incidental Lewy body disease, which showed Parkinson's disease pathology but no clinical symptoms and thus did not receive dopaminergic treatment. 
Additionally, we were able to culture neural stem cells from post-mortem brain of several patients with Parkinson's disease, confirming the presence of viable neural stem cells in these brains. 
We have also examined the subventricular zone of a chronic, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model, and again found no effect of dopaminergic denervation on precursor proliferation. 
In summary, the adult neural stem cell pool in the subventricular zone was not clearly affected in the human parkinsonian brain or a Parkinson's disease mouse model.

 Impulsive-compulsive behaviours (ICBs) are an increasingly well-recognised adverse-effect of dopaminergic medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 A promising target for improved therapeutics in Parkinson's disease is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). 
Accumulating evidence suggests that drugs such as nicotine that act at these sites may be of benefit for Parkinson's disease treatment.

There are scarce data that in Parkinson's disease, activity of the central histaminergic system is increased. 
The element manganese, an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, itself in toxic amount, replicates some clinical features similar to those of Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of neonatal manganese exposure on 6-OHDA modeling of Parkinson's disease in rats, and to determine effects on histamine content in the brain of these rats in adulthood. 
These findings indicate that histamine and the central histaminergic system are altered in the brain of rats lesioned to model Parkinson's disease, and that manganese enhances effects of 6-OHDA on histamine in brain. 
Thus, these CS nanoparticles represent an interesting technological platform for DA brain delivery and, hence, may be useful for Parkinson's disease treatment.

Therefore, elucidation of mechanisms for the regulation of dopamine D(1) receptor signaling is required to identify therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease and drug addiction. 
Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is straightforward with classic presentation, but accurate distinction among Parkinsonian variants may be difficult; non-Parkinson's disease conditions are commonly misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and ~20% of patients with Parkinson's disease are not clinically diagnosed despite coming to medical attention. 
Abnormal imaging indicates underlying nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, supportive of a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism or dementia with Lewy bodies, and identifies patient groups in whom dopaminergic therapy may be beneficial. 
Dopaminergic system imaging may be particularly valuable in patients with clinically inconclusive parkinsonism or a clinical diagnosis of possible dementia with Lewy bodies; it is not helpful in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism, although postsynaptic dopaminergic imaging may be of utility. 
Other potential uses of dopamine transporter imaging include identification of patients with premotor Parkinson's disease, monitoring disease progression in testing novel therapeutics, and as an inclusion criterion for entry into clinical trials. 
 Several selective antagonists for adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) are currently under evaluation in clinical trials (phases I to III) to treat Parkinson's disease, and they will probably soon reach the market. 
 Problems with impulse control and pathological gambling are known as possible side effects of dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We report 2 cases of pathological gambling induced by dopamine agonists in patients without Parkinson's disease. 
The two cases implicate pathological gambling as a possible consequence of dopaminergic treatment and support the increasing evidence regarding pathological gambling as an adverse drug reaction of dopaminergic treatment, also in patients who do not suffer from Parkinson's disease. 
 The most frequent neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with protein TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP).

 We have previously found that average serum cGMP level in unselected patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in patients treated with a combination of l-DOPA and the dopamine agonist pergolide mesylate, is markedly higher than that in healthy controls. 
As a neuropsychiatric syndrome, apathy is also common in patients with other neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, cerebrovascular accident, dementia, and other neurodegenerative conditions. 
Evidence can only be extrapolated from interventional studies done in other basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia.

 Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is a common but underestimated feature in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The aim of our study was to investigate, for the first time, whether levodopa medication influences motor inhibition and conflict resolution on the conditional stop-signal reaction time task in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) tested on or off their medication. 
 BACKGROUND: Since methamphetamine and other amphetamine-type stimulants (meth/amphetamine) can damage dopaminergic neurons, researchers have long speculated that these drugs may predispose users to develop Parkinson's disease (PD), a dopamine deficiency neurological disorder. 
 The compulsive use of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) or dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is one of the behavioural disturbances reported in some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other disorders who are receiving DRT. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with a higher incidence in the male population. 
 A transdermal patch formulation of the non-ergolinic dopamine agonist rotigotine (Neupro®) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease and as combination therapy with levodopa throughout the course of the disease. 
In six large, well designed clinical trials, rotigotine was an efficacious treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
In early Parkinson's disease, rotigotine initiated without levodopa produced significantly greater improvements than placebo in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) summed motor and activities of daily living (ADL) scores, as well as significantly higher response rates. 
In advanced Parkinson's disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reduced 'off' time and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. 
Thus, rotigotine offers a novel approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, given its ease of administration, efficacy in reducing disabling motor and non-motor symptoms, and acceptable tolerability profile, it has the potential to be an attractive treatment option for this highly debilitating disease. 
 Previous studies have suggested that R-apomorphine (R-APO), a non-selective dopamine (DA) receptor agonist, has neuroprotective effects in the experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Despite this, a reliable trait biomarker of sporadic Parkinson's disease has not emerged from measurements of cerebrospinal fluid dopamine metabolites. 
In this study, we analyzed cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of homovanillic acid (the major catabolite of dopamine) and the purine compound xanthine for a comparison of 217 unmedicated Parkinson's disease subjects and 26 healthy controls. 
These compounds were highly correlated for both the Parkinson's disease subjects (r=0.68) and for controls (r=0.73; both groups, p<0.001). 
While neither homovanillic acid nor xanthine concentrations differentiated Parkinson's disease from controls, their ratio did. 
For controls, the mean [xanthine]/[homovanillic acid] quotient was 13.1±5.5 as compared to the Parkinson's disease value of 17.4±6.7 at an initial lumbar CSF collection (p=0.0017), and 19.7±8.7 (p<0.001) at a second CSF collection up to 24 months later. 
The [xanthine]/[homovanillic acid] ratio in the Parkinson's disease subjects differed as a function of disease severity, as measured by the sum of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Activities of Daily Living and Motor Exam ratings. 
The [xanthine]/[homovanillic acid] ratio also increased between the first and second CSF collections, suggesting that this quotient provides both a state and trait biomarker of Parkinson's disease. 
These observations add to other neurochemical evidence that links purine metabolism to Parkinson's disease. 
Recent reports of reduced levels of expression of both Aldh1a1 mRNA and protein in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease patients suggest possible involvement of ALDH1A1 in this progressive neurodegenerative disease. 
 The mechanisms underlying the chronic neurodegeneration that occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD) are unknown. 
 Oxidative damage in the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms which may be important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. 
 Switching between different coordinated movements has been shown to be slow, with delayed responses and even freezing deficits in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine, a potent neurotransmitter in the brain, influences a variety of motivated behaviors and plays a major role in Parkinson's disease. 
The effect of dopamine agonists in general on the prevalence of ischemic events in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been studied. 
There is increasing evidence that GBA mutations are a genetic risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Interaction between glutamate and dopamine signaling is crucial for the control of movement and reward-driven learning, and its alterations are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease and drug addiction. 
 BACKGROUND: Adverse effects of dopaminergic medication (DA; levodopa and dopamine agonists) on impulsive behaviour and decision-making in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been repeatedly reported. 
 BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease there is progressive loss of dopamine containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
The purpose of this study was to examine causes of progressive damage in the caudate nucleus, which plays a major role in motor coordination and cognition, in experimental Parkinson's disease. 
RESULTS: Using chronic 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment of rhesus monkeys to model Parkinson's disease, we found a upregulation of Cathepsin D, a lysosomal aspartic protease, in the caudate nucleus of treated monkeys. 
CONCLUSIONS: Following damage to the substantia nigra resulting in experimental Parkinson's disease, we have identified pathological changes in the caudate nucleus, a likely site of changes leading to the progression of disease. 
This work may provide plausible explanations for the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease and pave the way towards a model-based, network level analysis and closed-loop control and optimization of DBS parameters, among many other applications. 
 Cognitive dysfunction can be common among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and multiplication of the gene α-synuclein (αsyn) increases the risk of dementia. 
Experimental evidence suggests that TAs modulate the activity of catecholaminergic neurons and that TA dysregulation may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and Parkinson's disease, all of which are characterized by altered monoaminergic networks. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system and dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum. 
 Mutations in the N-terminus of the gene encoding α-synuclein (α-syn) are linked to autosomal dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In a rat model of Parkinson's disease the medium spiny neurons projecting to the globus pallidus (indirect pathway) show more depolarized up states and increased firing. 
This is translated into abnormal patterns of synchronization between the globus pallidus and frontal cortex, which are believed to underlie the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 Neurotrophic factors regulate the development and maintenance of the nervous system and protect and repair dopaminergic neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Deficits in manual motor control often accompany the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), and are often revealed through isometric force tasks. 
 The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease rests on motor signs of advanced central dopamine deficiency. 
Clinicopathological evidence suggests that α-synuclein aggregation, the pathological signature of Parkinson's disease, can be detected in gastrointestinal tract neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
We studied whether we could demonstrate α-synuclein pathology in specimens from unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy of the distal sigmoid colon in early subjects with Parkinson's disease. 
Ten subjects with early Parkinson's disease not treated with dopaminergic agents (7 men; median age, 58.5 years; median disease duration, 1.5 years) underwent unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy of the distal sigmoid colon. 
Nine of 10 Parkinson's disease samples were adequate for study. 
3-Nitrotyrosine staining was seen in 87% of Parkinson's disease cases but was not specific for Parkinson's disease. 
This study suggests a pattern of α-synuclein staining in Parkinson's disease that was distinct from healthy subjects and those with inflammatory bowel disease. 
 Depression is a common problem experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by its motor symptoms, it is now well recognized that cognitive and affective domains, such as recognition of emotion from facial expressions, may also be impaired. 
 Cell specificity of gene expression analysis is essential to avoid tissue sample related artifacts, in particular when the relative number of target cells present in the compared tissues varies dramatically, e.g., when comparing dopamine neurons in midbrain tissues from control subjects with those from Parkinson's disease (PD) cases. 
Motor disabilities in patients and animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) may be caused by dopamine (DA)-depleted basal ganglia that abnormally process the information originating from MC. 
In Parkinson's disease, DA cell bodies within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) progressively degenerate, with causes and mechanisms poorly understood. 
CONCLUSION: These results defining a novel Wnt1/Fzd-1/β-catenin astrocyte-DA autoprotective loop provide a new mechanistic inside into the regulation of pro-survival processes, with potentially relevant consequences for drug design or drug action in Parkinson's disease. 
 Previous studies have shown that over-expression of alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), a protein whose abnormality is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), reduces tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and dopamine synthesis. 
In addition to exploratory and somatosensory behavior, motor skills that are thought to be directly translatable to human Parkinson's disease patients are assessed. 
Not surprisingly, abnormal striatal NO-sGC-cGMP signaling becomes apparent following striatal DA depletion, an alteration thought to contribute to pathophysiological changes observed in basal ganglia circuits in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease, an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, the accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and neurites, and neuroinflammation. 
While the exact etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease remains elusive, a growing body of evidence suggests that misfolded α-synuclein promotes inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in neurodegeneration. 
 PURPOSE: Subtle cognitive impairment is recognized in the first stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), including executive, memory and visuospatial dysfunction, but its pathophysiological basis is still debated. 
As Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopamine and is associated with central pain, we considered how endogenous morphine is regulated in the untreated and l-DOPA-treated parkinsonian brain. 
We then studied changes in the endogenous morphine-like compound immunoreactivity of medium spiny neurons in normal, Parkinson's disease-like and l-DOPA-treated Parkinson's disease-like conditions in experimental (rat and monkey) and human Parkinson's disease. 
Our results reveal an unexpected dramatic upregulation of neuronal endogenous morphine-like compound immunoreactivity and levels in experimental and human Parkinson's disease, only partially normalized by l-DOPA treatment. 
The functional consequences of such endogenous morphine upregulation are as yet unknown, but based upon the current knowledge of morphine signalling, we hypothesize that it is involved in fatigue, depression and pain symptoms experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa-induced dyskinesia is a major complication of long-term dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease that becomes increasingly problematic in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study, we aimed to explore control of plasticity in patients with Parkinson's disease with and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias by taking advantage of a newly developed protocol that tests depotentiation of pre-existing long-term potentiation-like synaptic facilitation. 
Long-term potentiation-like plasticity and its reversibility were studied in the motor cortex of 10 healthy subjects, 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesias, who took half of the regular dose of levodopa and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease without levodopa-induced dyskinesias, who took either half or the full dose of levodopa. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease without levodopa-induced dyskinesias had normal long-term potentiation- and depotentiation-like effects when they took their full dose of levodopa, but there was no long-term potentiation-like effect when they were on half dose of levodopa. 
The results suggest that depotentiation is abnormal in the motor cortex of patients with Parkinson's disease with levodopa-induced dyskinesias and that their long-term potentiation-like plasticity is more readily affected by administration of levodopa than their clinical symptoms. 
Quantification of DAT levels in the presynaptic site using (11)C-N-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane ((11)C-CFT) with positron emission tomography (PET) was applied in studies for Parkinson's disease. 
Specifically, chronic exposure to high levels of manganese leads to manganism, a neurological disorder that exhibits both motor and learning deficits similar to Parkinson's disease. 
Since Parkinson's disease symptomatology is primarily attributed to dopamine neurodegeneration in the striatum, dopamine system dysfunction has been implicated in the onset of manganism. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) and cerebral ischemia are chronic and acute neurodegenerative diseases, respectively, and onsets of these diseases are thought to be induced at least by oxidative stress. 
Although α-synuclein is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and diffuse Lewy body disease, the mechanism of action is not completely understood. 
 The increased risk of cardiac valve disease in patients treated for Parkinson's disease with cabergoline has raised concerns about the safety of treatment with ergot-derived dopamine agonists in patients with endocrine diseases, especially prolactinoma.

 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to review the recent advances in the epidemiology and pathophysiology of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease. 
RECENT FINDINGS: Large cross-sectional and case-control multicentre studies show that ICDs in Parkinson's disease are common, with a frequency of 13.6%. 
SUMMARY: Recent large-scale studies and converging findings are beginning to provide an understanding of mechanisms underlying ICDs in Parkinson's disease, which can guide prevention of these behaviours and optimize therapeutic approaches. 
 BACKGROUND: Non-ergoline dopamine agonists (DA) are effective treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These findings suggest that PH stimulation might be a promising treatment for akinesia associated with dopamine loss in Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, chronic dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease may modify both synaptic transmission and integration in the subthalamic nucleus, in addition to its effects on other regions of the basal ganglia. 
 There is consensus that amelioration of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is most effective with L-DOPA (levodopa). 
This review presents the current views on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative/proteolytic stress, the factors that can be affected by L-DOPA or its metabolites. 
L-DOPA remains the symptomatic 'hero' of Parkinson's disease. 
 The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion is the most widely used rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: This study used the dopamine transporter (DAT) probe, [(123)I]-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)-N-(3-iodo-E-allyl)nortropane ([(123)I]altropane), to assess the DAT levels in the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
 5-HT plays a regulatory role in voluntary movements of the basal ganglia and has a major impact on disorders of the basal ganglia such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Excessive burst firing in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia correlates with severe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease that are attenuated by high frequency electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). 
 Electrophysiological studies in patients and animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) often reported increased burst activity of neurons in the basal ganglia. 
 The neuroprotective effect of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor has been extensively studied in various toxic models of Parkinson's disease. 
In addition, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor overexpression did not ameliorate the behavioural deficit in this rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These data provide the evidence for the lack of neuroprotective effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor against the toxicity of human wild-type α-synuclein in an in vivo model of Parkinson's disease. 
The difference in neuroprotective efficacy of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor seen in our model and the commonly used neurotoxin models of Parkinson's disease, raises important issues pertinent to the interpretation of the results obtained in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease, and their relevance for the therapeutic use glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Impulse control disorders (ICDs), specifically those related to excessive gambling, eating, sex and shopping, have been observed in a subset of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dysfunction in orofacial movement is evident in patients with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. 
 The molecular mechanisms inherent to cell death associated with Parkinson's disease are not clearly understood. 
 Degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus are important pathological features of Parkinson's disease. 
There is an urgent need to develop therapies that slow down the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
This suggests that the use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists may be a useful strategy to reduce degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: We studied the prevalence and related risk factors of impulse control disorders in Chinese Parkinson's disease patients. 
METHOD: We screened all non-demented Parkinson's disease patients attending our Parkinson's disease clinic from August 2009 to March 2010. 
Upon multivariate analysis, dose of dopamine agonist used, young age at onset of Parkinson's disease and a history of anxiety or depression were independent predictors for developing impulse control disorders. 
When young Parkinson's disease patients with a history of anxiety or depression are treated with high dose of DA, they are at risk of developing impulse control disorders. 
 Hyposmia is highly prevalent in the motor phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is an established pre-motor sign of PD that may precede the onset of motor symptoms by as long as 5 years.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) results from progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. 
 Damage to DNA by dopamine quinone and/or catechol estrogen quinones may play a significant role in the initiation of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) improves the motor symptoms. 
Whether these behaviors are related to the dopaminergic medications interacting with an underlying individual vulnerability or whether the primary pathological features of Parkinson's disease play a role is not entirely understood. 
We further review the literature studies that investigated the decision-making profile using the Iowa Gambling Task in Parkinson's disease, and the recent literature devoted to these abnormal behaviors in the restless legs syndrome (RLS). 
The refinement of clinical strategies to predict, identify and manage DDS will help the future care of motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by the progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder which affects widespread areas of the brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. 
However, a number of issues advise caution before categorizing Parkinson's disease as a prion disorder, because clinical appearance, brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid and neuropathological findings exhibit fundamental differences between both disease entities. 
 Dopamine (DA), as a neurotoxin, can elicit severe Parkinson's disease-like syndrome by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptotic activity. 
 Depression and anxiety are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and have important consequences on quality of life. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disorder of middle-aged and elderly people in which degeneration of the extrapyramidal motor system causes significant movement problems. 
Abnormal dopamine signal transmission in the brain has been implicated in diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia, as well as in various types of drug addition. 
 This study examined whether ethyl pyruvate (EP) promotes the survival of nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. 
The present findings show that EP may inhibit glial-mediated oxidative stress, suggesting that EP may have therapeutic value in the treatment of aspects of Parkinson's disease related to glia-derived oxidative damage. 
 Exposure to excessive manganese (Mn) levels leads to neurotoxicity, referred to as manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Altogether these data suggest that drugs directed to α6 containing nAChRs may be of benefit for the treatment of addiction and for neurological disorders with locomotor deficits such as Parkinson's disease. 
 The interactions between certain α-synuclein (SNCA) conformations and dopamine (DA) metabolism cause selective DA neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs) have been reported to occur frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD) and include impulse control disorders (ICDs), punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (SSD). 
 Loss of frontal neocortical activation is one of the main neurophysiological abnormalities of Parkinson's disease (PD) and can be observed in rodent models of nigrostriatal degeneration. 
In this study, we investigated its neuroprotective effects in a chronic rotenone rat model for Parkinson's disease. 
 Pro-inflammatory cytokines released from activated microglia may be responsible for neuronal damage and resulting motor deficits associated with CNS disorders such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. 
METHODS: Observational studies addressing the frequency of moderate or severe valvular regurgitation among ergoline-treated patients with Parkinson's disease were considered for a meta-analysis. 
However, scarce information has so far been obtained on the neuroactive steroid levels present in Parkinson's disease. 
Altogether, these results suggesting that progesterone metabolism is affected in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease further highlight the link between neuroactive steroids and the neurodegenerative diseases.

Early deficiencies have been linked with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, and adult deficiencies have been associated with a host of adverse brain outcomes, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression and cognitive decline. 
 OBJECTIVE: To examine genetic associations of polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and D3 (DRD3) genes with risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Fetal brain tissue can be used in cell replacement therapy for PD (Parkinson's disease), but there is a poor donor supply of this tissue. 
 The prevalence of pathological gambling is 3.4% to 6% in treated Parkinson's disease, which is higher than the background population rate. 
A PubMed literature search using the terms "gambling" and "Parkinson's disease," "impulse control disorder," "impulsive compulsive behaviour," "dopamine agonist," of individual dopamine agonists, and of ongoing drug trials, using http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, was carried out for the period up to January 2011. 
Fifteen studies assessed the topic of anhedonia in Parkinson's disease from 1984 to 2009 and mainly described it as a core symptom of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that in Parkinson's disease anhedonia is a secondary phenomenon linked to depression, apathy severity, and frontal lobe dysregulation and that it could respond to antiparkinsonian treatment. 
Furthermore, more reliable tools and validated diagnostic criteria are necessary to assess anhedonia in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent studies have reported cognitive decline to be common in the early phase of Parkinson's disease. 
This relationship has been sparsely investigated in population-based studies of untreated Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between motor signs and cognitive performance in the early stages of Parkinson's disease before the intake of dopaminergic medication. 
In the case of Parkinson's disease, a degenerative process caused by gradual disappearance of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, it is suspected that the targets for treatment should be dopamine-receptor-containing heteromers. 
This might provide a better insight into their pharmacological and functional inter-relationships in the brain and enable the design and evaluation of new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease. 
These findings may help to elucidate the basis of therapeutic benefit observed with these drugs, with varying mechanisms of action, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, depression and schizophrenia. 
Early studies have demonstrated that interaction of α-SYN and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, is functionally significant for dopaminergic neurotransmission and the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and motor symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor at rest. 
 Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to develop motor complications after a few years of levodopa (L-dopa) therapy. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by striatal dopamine deficiency and overactivity of the STN and underactivation of the pre-SMA during movement. 
 High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the neurosurgical therapy of choice for the management of motor deficits in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but this treatment can elicit disabling mood changes. 
Implications of these primate studies are: (1) the susceptibility of dopamine neurons at mid-gestation to methamphetamine warns against the risk of exposing pregnant women to the drug or oxidative stressors, and supports the hypothesis of Parkinson's disease being associated with oxidative stress during development, (2) elucidation of the mechanism of resistance of dopamine neurons in the young animals to methamphetamine-induced oxidative stress may provide targets for slowing or preventing age- or disease-related loss of adult nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons, and (3) the increased striatal production of GDNF in young animals, but not in adults, in response to methamphetamine, suggests the possibility of an age-related change in the neurotrophic capacity of the striatal dopamine system. 
 Progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms is imperfectly correlated with positron emission tomography biomarkers for dopamine biosynthetic pathways. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate 6-[(18) F]fluoro-m-tyrosine relative to 6-[(18) F]fluoro-L-dopa with partial catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition as a biomarker for clinical status in Parkinson's disease. 
Twelve patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, off medication, underwent Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scoring, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and 3-dimensional dynamic positron emission tomography using equivalent doses of 6-[(18) F]fluoro-m-tyrosine and 6-[(18) F]fluoro-L-dopa with tolcapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor. 
 Consistent with the hypothesis that dopamine is implicated in the processing of salient stimuli relevant to the modification of various behavioral responses, Parkinson's disease is associated with emotional blunting. 
To address the hypothesis that emotional attention and memory are modulated by dopaminergic neurotransmission in Parkinson's disease, we assessed 15 nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease while on and off dopaminergic medication and 15 age-matched healthy controls. 
Controls had significantly better memory for positive than negative stimuli, whereas patients with Parkinson's disease tested off medication had significantly better memory for negative than positive items. 
Reaction times in patients with Parkinson's disease off medication were longer than in healthy controls and, paradoxically, were even longer when on medication. 
Further, although both healthy controls and patients with Parkinson's disease in the "off" state had arousal-induced prolongation of reaction time, this effect was not seen in patients with Parkinson's disease on medication. 
Furthermore, our findings suggest that emotional changes in Parkinson's disease result from the effects of both the disease process and dopaminergic treatment. 
 In the mid-1980s, the treatment of Parkinson's disease was quite exclusively centered on dopatherapy and was focusing on dopamine systems and motor symptoms. 
A few dopamine agonists and a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (selegiline) were used as adjuncts in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
The demonstration of an antidyskinetic effect of the glutamate antagonist amantadine opened the door for novel nondopaminergic approaches of Parkinson's disease therapy. 
Despite therapeutic advances, Parkinson's disease continues to be a relentlessly progressive disorder leading to severe disability. 
Neuroprotective interventions able to modify the progression of Parkinson's disease have stood out as a failed therapeutic goal over the last 2 decades, despite potentially encouraging results with compounds like rasagiline. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by protein accumulation in the form of Lewy bodies and neurites. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose cardinal manifestations are due primarily to a profound deficit in brain dopamine. 
In an attempt to shed light on the neurobiology of Parkinson's disease, a number of experimental models have been developed, especially during the last 25 years. 
These models can also be recast as etiologic, pathogenic, and symptomatic/pathophysiologic, as each may contribute to our understanding of the cause, the mechanisms, and the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In this review, we will discuss the question of Parkinson's disease models, starting from the period when this journal was born to today. 
During this journey of 25 years, we will discuss both the significant contributions of the Parkinson's disease models and hurdles that remain to be overcome to one day cure this neurological disease. 
The authors review highlights of this work, with a focus on advances in Parkinson's disease, the dystonias, Huntington's disease, and the role of dopamine in cognition and reward signaling. 
 Although increasing evidence indicates that psychiatric symptoms are crucial characteristic of the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) and precede motor impairments, the neuronal firing activity of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) in the psychiatric symptom of PD and the involved mechanism are still unclear. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons within the substantia nigra. 
In affected cells of various neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondrial membrane and enters the cytosol. 
The pattern of greater DA depletion in putamen than in caudate in aged monkeys is the same as in human Parkinson's disease and contrasts with the greater depletion in caudate seen after MPTP. 
Aged monkeys of this species reflect many facets of Parkinson's disease, but like older humans do not improve with standard dopamine replacement pharmacotherapies. 
 BACKGROUND: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) in Parkinson's disease are motivation-based behaviours that involve repetitive occurrences of impulsive and uncontrolled activity. 
Whilst matching clinical and biological evidence, any such psychiatric classification in Parkinson's disease will remain complicated by the interactions of pathophysiology and medication and fail to capture the range of subthreshold but still clinically significant symptomatology. 
 Dyskinesia induction in Parkinson's disease (PD) appears less marked with long-acting dopamine agonists than with short-acting L-Dopa, but the relationship to duration of drug action is unknown. 
 Levodopa induces long-term motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Graft-induced dyskinesias are a serious complication after neural transplantation in Parkinson's disease. 
One patient with Parkinson's disease, treated with fetal grafts 14 years ago and deep brain stimulation 6 years ago, showed marked improvement of motor symptoms but continued to suffer from OFF-medication graft-induced dyskinesias. 
Our data provide further evidence that serotonergic neurons mediate graft-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. 
 PURPOSE: Psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are relatively common and, in addition to creating a disturbance in patients' daily lives, have consistently been shown to be associated with poor outcome. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD)-like symptoms including learning deficits are inducible by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 
In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), impulse control disorder (ICD) can result from dopaminergic medication use, particularly dopamine agonists (DAA). 
 Nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) may emerge secondary to the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, while others are recognized side effects of treatment. 
 Both limb and cranial motor functions are adversely impacted by Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Further, we propose that cranial motor impairments in PD may be mediated by pathology both within and outside nigrostriatal dopamine system.LEARNING OUTCOMES: Readers will be able to (a) describe a set of motor tests used to assess limb motor and cranial motor function in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, (b) understand the application of intracortical microstimulation to assess corticospinal and corticobulbar circuits, (c) describe the differential effects of dopamine depletion on limb motor and cranial motor function in a rodent model of PD, and (d) understand the potential role of dysfunction outside the nigrostriatal system mediating cranial motor impairments in Parkinson's disease. 
 Multiple laboratories have recently demonstrated that long-term dopaminergic transplants form Lewy bodies in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These data indicate that it is possible for host derived α synuclein to transfer to grafted neurons supporting the concept that this is one possible mechanism by which grafted dopamine neurons form Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Fetal dopamine (DA) cell transplantation has shown to be efficient in reversing behavioral impairments associated with Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study we have evaluated the influence of different ratios of DA neurons in relation to 5-HT neurons in the graft on spontaneous motor behavior and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a late-onset, progressive and neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology. 
Comparison of the experimental and modeling data suggest that brain activity in Parkinson's disease resides in the large boundary region between synchronized and nonsynchronized dynamics. 
 The central aim of our study was to elucidate functions mediated by the ventral and dorsal striatum, respectively, to better understand the cognitive effects of dopamine replacement in Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease, dopamine depletion is substantially less notable in the ventral relative to the dorsal striatum, and therefore greater improvements are expected for dorsal striatum-mediated functions with dopamine replacement. 
In summary, we present a within-subject, double dissociation of the effects of dopamine replacement in patients with Parkinson's disease for ventral striatum-mediated facilitation and dorsal striatum-mediated interference, confirmed in a separate functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. 
Titration of therapy in Parkinson's disease is generally geared towards optimizing dorsal striatum-mediated motor symptoms, possibly at the expense of ventral striatum operations, a consequence that is only beginning to be recognized. 
 Impulse control disorders are common in Parkinson's disease, occurring in 13.6% of patients. 
Using a pharmacological manipulation and a novel risk taking task while performing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the relationship between dopamine agonists and risk taking in patients with Parkinson's disease with and without impulse control disorders. 
Fourteen impulse control disorder (problem gambling or compulsive shopping) and 14 matched Parkinson's disease controls were tested ON and OFF dopamine agonists. 
Patients with impulse control disorder made more risky choices in the 'Gain' relative to the 'Loss' condition along with decreased orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate activity, with the opposite observed in Parkinson's disease controls. 
In patients with impulse control disorder, dopamine agonists were associated with enhanced sensitivity to risk along with decreased ventral striatal activity again with the opposite in Parkinson's disease controls. 
 The biometals iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) have been associated to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinsonism. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive age-related movement disorder that results primarily from the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. 
The finding that the complete loss of synucleins leads to changes in dopamine handling by presynaptic terminals specifically in those regions preferentially vulnerable in Parkinson's disease may ultimately inform on the selectivity of the disease process. 
 Ageing is the greatest risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease. 
However, the current dogma holds that cellular mechanisms that are associated with ageing of midbrain dopamine neurons and those that are related to dopamine neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease are unrelated. 
We propose, based on evidence from studies of non-human primates, that normal ageing and the degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease are linked by the same cellular mechanisms and, therefore, that markers of cellular risk factors accumulate with age in a pattern that mimics the pattern of degeneration observed in Parkinson's disease. 
We contend that ageing induces a pre-parkinsonian state, and that the cellular mechanisms of dopamine neuron demise during normal ageing are accelerated or exaggerated in Parkinson's disease through a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
 Amantadine is commonly given to alleviate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
However, the effect of this drug on the pathology caused by overexpression and aggregation of alpha-synuclein, including Parkinson's disease (PD), has not been assessed. 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased striatal dopamine levels. 
We now report that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), an active component of propolis, attenuated dopaminergic neurodegeneration and dopamine loss in the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, CAPE may have beneficial effects in slowing or preventing the progression of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. 
 Effective numerical expansion of dopaminergic precursors might overcome the limited availability of transplantable cells in replacement strategies for Parkinson's disease. 
 We investigated the alteration of dopaminergic system in striata of Parkinson's disease (PD) at different stages using positron emission tomography (PET), [(11)C]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT) for dopamine transporter (DAT), and [(11)C]raclopride (RAC) for dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). 
 The administration of dopamine agonists in Parkinson's disease has been associated with impulse control disorders, in particular, pathological gambling. 
In the present investigation, 17 patients with Parkinson's disease without impulse control disorders and 17 matched control participants were offered choices between monetary rewards (ranging between 11 and 80 euros) available immediately and larger rewards (between 25 and 85 euros) available after delays ranging from 7 to 186 days. 
This study shows that patients with Parkinson's disease without clinically apparent impulse control disorders nevertheless tend to make impulsive decisions in intertemporal monetary choice. 
The lack of difference between sessions could be a result either of the persistent effects of dopaminergic therapy or hint at a genuine medication-independent change in intertemporal choice behavior in Parkinson's disease. 
The paradigm used is easy to apply and should be used more extensively to describe decision behavior in Parkinson's disease. 
 PURPOSE: We used a novel apoptosis-targeting peptide called ApoPep-1 in order to evaluate whether ApoPep-1 can be used as a diagnostic indicator in a model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Classically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to dopamine neuron death in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
 Effects of silencing ectopically expressed hSNCA in rat substantia nigra (SN) were examined as a novel therapeutic approach to Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Biogenic amine systems are damaged by amphetamine abuse and in Parkinson's disease. 
In addition, this mutation conferred resistance to 6-hydroxydopamine damage to dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease model. 
elegans innate immunity, suggesting that this pathway may play a role in biogenic amine toxicity system damage due to amphetamines and in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in higher organisms. 
 Tyrosine kinase receptors TrkB and TrkC mediate neuroprotective effects of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophins in the dopaminergic nigro-striatal system, but it is obscure about their responses or expression changes in the injured substantia nigra under Parkinson's disease. 
This study has indicated that TrkB-containing dopamine neurons are less sensitive in the substantia nigra of MPTP mouse model, suggesting that specific organization of Trks may be involved in neuronal vulnerability to MPTP insult, and BDNF-TrkB signaling may play more important role in protecting dopamine neurons and exhibit therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease. 
 Impaired axonal transport may play a key role in Parkinson's disease. 
 l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, but long-term l-DOPA administration is marred by the emergence of motor complications, namely, dyskinesia and a shortening of antiparkinsonian benefit (wearing-OFF). 
 Nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be as disabling as the much better studied motor symptoms. 
Also, sleep disturbances seen in Parkinson's disease can range from temporarily increased daytime sleepiness after introduction of a dopamine agonist to the therapeutic regime to specific sleep-related diagnoses such as restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, periodic limb movements in sleep, and sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. 
In this review, we discuss the different specific sleep disturbances that arise in the context of Parkinson's disease with a special emphasis on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis. 
 Dopamine replacement treatment with excessive or aberrant dopamine receptor stimulation can cause behavioral disturbances in Parkinson's disease, comprising dopamine dysregulation syndrome, punding, and impulse control disorders. 
 There is now accumulating evidence that the combination of progressive pathology of Parkinson's disease, the change in drug pharmacodynamics, and the pulsatile manner in which short-acting dopaminergic agents stimulate striatal dopamine receptors are the key contributing factors to the priming of the basal ganglia for induction of motor complications. 
Dopamine agonists have been extensively used as monotherapy and add-on therapy to levodopa to treat Parkinson's disease in the early stage and with motor complications. 
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate dopaminergic function in a large cohort of patients with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and describe its relationship with clinical features in comparison to Parkinson's disease and healthy control subjects. 
 The dopamine agonist medications, pramipexole and ropinirole, are commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 SIGNIFICANCE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in part, by the progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neuron cell bodies within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the associated deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in the striatum, which gives rise to the typical motor symptoms of PD. 
In this review, we provide an overview of toxin models of mitochondrial dysfunction in experimental Parkinson's disease and discuss mitochondrial mechanisms of neurotoxicity. 
 PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to estimate normal ranges and test-retest measures for various parameters characterising dopamine metabolism from a prolonged (18)F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) measurement using a reference tissue model and compare their value for the detection of early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The aim in this study was to investigate whether neurologists in Germany adhered to the national Parkinson's disease guideline. 
Analyses were performed on 320 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease with either low grades of functional impairment (Hoehn and Yahr stage I) or higher grades of functional impairment (stage II-V) but without motor complications. 
Thus, rotenone, which produces a model of Parkinson's disease in rodents, may increase the risk of dopamine neuron excitotoxicity. 
The main objective of our study was to examine whether genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of P2X7 receptors influenced dopaminergic cell death in various models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease often complain of fatigue, and although cardiac sympathetic denervation is thought to be associated with fatigue, this link remains unclear. 
Previously, we detected cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients with Parkinson's disease using dobutamine, a selective beta-1 stimulant. 
To clarify the involvement of autonomic dysfunction in fatigue in Parkinson's disease, we conducted autonomic function tests on 33 patients with Parkinson's disease (mean age, 66.1 ± 5.6 years; 20 men, 13 women) and evaluated their relationships to fatigue. 
Our results suggest that autonomic dysfunction, including cardiac sympathetic denervation, is associated with fatigue in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The development of an impulse control disorder (ICD) is now recognized as a potential nonmotor adverse effect of dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The objective of this study was to investigate whether higher levels of urate, an antioxidant linked to a lower likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease, is also a predictor of having a dopamine transporter brain scan without evidence of dopaminergic deficit. 
In a cross-sectional study of 797 mildly affected, untreated parkinsonian subjects diagnosed with early Parkinson's disease in the Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial, we investigated the relationship at baseline between serum urate and striatal dopamine transporter density, determined by single-photon emission computed tomography of iodine-123-labeled 2-β-carboxymethoxy-3-β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane uptake. 
We examined the role of dopamine in this phenomenon by testing 13 mildly affected patients with Parkinson's disease, off and on dopaminergic medications, and 13 healthy, age-matched controls.

AREAS COVERED: In this review we present a brief overview of the principles and procedures related to in vivo microdialysis and detail the use of this technique in the pre-clinical measurement of drugs designed to be used in the treatment of chemical addiction, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and as well as psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. 
 The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leads to the characteristic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremors. 
Progress will rely on understanding genetic mutations or susceptibility factors that lead to Parkinson's disease, better translation between preclinical animal models and clinical research, and improving the design of future clinical trials. 
We review evidence from a series of studies with experimental animals, healthy humans, and patients with Parkinson's disease, which highlight two important factors that contribute to this large variability. 
 Apomorphine, a dopamine D₁/D₂ agonist is effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease; but its long term use is often associated with the dependence and addiction. 
Findings may help in extending therapeutics in Parkinson's disease. 
 In the absence of a cure for Parkinson's disease, development of preventive medications for this devastating disease is particularly encouraged. 
In this study, we investigated the effects of NBP in rotenone models for Parkinson's diseases. 
Together, NBP protects DA neurons likely by reducing oxidative stress, offering an alternative neuroprotective medication for Parkinson's disease. 
 Studies have suggested that neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) could be related to the pacemaker activity of the substantia nigra pars compacta generated by L-type Ca(v) 1.3 calcium channels, which progressively substitute voltage-dependent sodium channels in this region during aging. 
 The formulation and characterization of dopamine (DA)-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) are described as preliminary steps for the development of potential DA carrier systems intended for Parkinson's disease treatment. 
 Parkinson's disease is known for its effects on sensorimotor coordination caused by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway. 
Dopamine-innervated areas of the ventral striatum also become compromised in Parkinson's disease, and little is known about the potential impact of this pathology on motivational processes mediated by the mesolimbic dopamine system. 
The current study tested the hypothesis that patients with Parkinson's disease would show a deficit in appetitive motivational arousal. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease and age-matched healthy controls completed a visual discrimination task in which control and appetitive food images (incidental to the task) were presented in the background. 
In contrast, the Parkinson's disease group showed an inverse pattern to the healthy controls. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated an impairment in appetitive motivational arousal consistent with the progression of dopaminergic degeneration across the course of the disease. 
Dysfunction of this system affects quality of life in Parkinson's disease, and a blunting of the anticipatory motivation may contribute to the high prevalence of depression in Parkinson's disease. 
 Fibrotic valvular heart disease (VHD) has been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with dopamine receptor agonists such as pergolide and cabergoline. 
 Although epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (ErbB1) is implicated in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, the neurotrophic action of ErbB1 ligands on nigral dopaminergic neurons remains controversial. 
These data prompted us to study the effect of peripheral administration of Nrg1 in the context of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the dopaminergic system in the adult brain. 
In conclusion, we have identified Nrg1β(1)-ECD as a neurotrophic factor for adult mouse and human midbrain dopaminergic neurons with peripheral administratability, warranting further investigation as therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease patients. 
 The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are due to the progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). 
While MPTP exposure in humans causes permanent symptoms of Parkinson's disease, MPTP treated mice will recover behaviorally over a 3-week period. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to a decrease of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). 
 Manganese toxicity can cause a neurodegenerative disorder affecting cortical and basal ganglia structures with a neurological presentation resembling features of Parkinson's disease. 
 In patients with Parkinson's disease with higher prevalence than in current population there appear pathological behaviours characterized by compulsion, repetitiveness and impulsivity, which are connected with material profit or pleasurable experience. 
However, these studies were limited to Parkinson's disease patients. 
Disruption of this hierarchical organization and subsequent disordered beta-gamma balance in basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's disease may be important in the pathogenesis of their symptoms. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is characterised not only by the classic triad of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, but also by the frequent occurrence of various non-motor symptoms such as the impulse control disorders (pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive buying, binge eating, punding and dopamine dependency). 
AIM: To increase insight into the clinical presentation, risk factors, treatment and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease. 
RESULTS: Impulse control disorders belong to an important group of neuropsychiatric disorders that occur at some point in 5-10% of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSION: Early recognition of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease is important and a close collaboration between the neurologist and the psychiatrist is essential in order to ensure correct diagnosis and the best possible treatment. 
Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease show considerable phenomenological overlap with other repetitive behaviours within the impulsive-compulsive spectrum of disorders to which the obsessive-compulsive disorders and addiction disorders belong. 
 BACKGROUND: Entacapone is a promising drug used widely for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) as a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor. 
 Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are abnormal involuntary movements induced by the chronic use of levodopa (l-Dopa) limiting the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 Cognitive impairment can occur at all stages of Parkinson's disease. 
We assessed the effects of rasagiline on cognitive deficits in cognitively impaired, nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease receiving stable dopaminergic treatment were assigned to receive rasagiline 1 mg/day or placebo for 3 months. 
Patients were eligible if they had impairment in 2 of 4 cognitive domains (attention, executive functions, memory, visuospatial functions) in the screening neuropsychological tests, yet did not fulfill criteria for Parkinson's disease dementia. 
The monoamine oxidase type-B inhibitor rasagiline may exert beneficial effects on certain aspects of attention and executive functions in nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment. 
 L-dopa is one of the best treatments for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
NAChRs may therefore represent novel targets for Parkinson's disease management. 
Our combined findings indicate that α4β2* and α6β2* nAChRs may represent useful therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease. 
Several cases of OT have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD), either preceding the onset of OT or developing in long-standing PD, suggesting a dopaminergic control of the central oscillator, possibly in the posterior fossa. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD), a common degenerative disease in humans, is known to result from loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and is characterized by severe motor symptoms of tremor, rigidity, bradykinsia and postural instability. 
 Overexpression or mutation of α-synuclein (α-Syn), a protein associated with presynaptic vesicles, causes familial forms of Parkinson's disease in humans and is also associated with sporadic forms of the disease. 
Together, these data further validate this transgenic mouse line as a slowly progressing model of Parkinson's disease and provide evidence for early dopamine synaptic dysfunction prior to loss of striatal dopamine. 
 Normal circadian rhythms of behavior are disrupted in disorders involving the dopamine (DA) system, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly pesticides, may be an important etiological factor in Parkinson's disease (PD); and evidence suggests a role for microglia-dependent inflammatory and oxidative processes in nigrostriatal pathology induced by such toxins. 
 INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress is an essential component of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 OBJECTIVE: To review the nearly 30 papers suggesting that apathy may occur frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD) and that it may be a symptom or syndrome that is separate from depression. 
 Gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) may offer an alternative to current pharmacologic and surgical treatments; the former are limited by motor complications and non-motor adverse effects, and both by lack of neuroprotection. 
 Pharmacological studies of molecular mechanisms leading to the differentiation of neurons with retained dopaminergic fate and function suggest that such differentiation could be a form of treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia. 
 An extensive list of side effects and problems are associated with the administration of l-dopa (l-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) during treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These problems can preclude achieving an optimal response with l-dopa treatment.PURPOSE: To present a case study outlining a novel approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease that allows for management of problems associated with l-dopa administration and discusses the scientific basis for this treatment. 
Parkinson's disease is associated with depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. 
The findings establish a role for dopamine in the reversible suppression of neurogenesis in the midbrain and have implications for regenerative strategies in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD), a movement disorder related to dopamine insufficiency in the brain, affects 7 to 10 million people worldwide. 
 A decrease in activity of ubiquitin proteasome system results in accumulation of toxic forms of protein and cell degeneration, including dopamine (DA)-ergic neurons in the substantia nigra; these neurons are remarkable for their low proteolytic activity of proteosomes that makes them more vulnerable, especially when subjected to the neurotoxin action or Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The proposed mechanisms also explain the behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease. 
This study assessed changes in echocardiography evaluation of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) taking cabergoline or pergolide before and after the label revision and examined the factors related with echocardiography performance. 
dopamine and norepinephrine, are an important biochemical correlate of catecholaminergic neuron loss in some disabling neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly, notably Parkinson's disease. 
 Capillary electrophoresis based separations of the hypothesized Parkinson's disease biomarkers dopamine, epinephrine, pyrocatechol, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), glutathione, and uric acid are performed in the presence of a 1 nM 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid functionalized gold (Au@MUA) nanoparticle pseudostationary phase plug. 
 Loss of dopamine (DA) homeostasis may be a contributing factor to cell damage in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Fifteen patients with Parkinson's disease orally took one 200-mg levodopa/50-mg carbidopa (CD) containing tablet. 
 BACKGROUND: Independence of certain gait characteristics from dopamine replacement therapies highlights its complex pathophysiology in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Although the increased prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) with aging suggests that aging processes predispose dopamine neurons to degeneration, the mechanism involved remains unknown. 
 OPINION STATEMENT: Dementia in Parkinson's disease encompasses a spectrum relating to motor, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms that are classified as either Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) (initial cognitive symptoms) or Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) (initial motor signs preceding cognitive symptoms by at least a year). 
Patients can present with any feature or combination of features of organic Parkinson's disease. 
Patients may have both organic Parkinson's disease and psychogenic parkinsonism, and this might be considered a psychologically induced aggravation of the organic disorder. 
 OBJECTIVE: Neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, and Parkinson's disease cause disability and immobilization that increases the risk of hip fracture. 
RESULTS: Seven RCTs met the criteria, including two of etidronate (ALS and stroke), two of alendronate (stroke and Parkinson's disease), and three of risedronate (stroke and Parkinson's disease). 
CONCLUSION: A meta-analysis of RCTs suggested that oral bisphosphonate treatment prevents hip fracture in disabled Japanese patients with neurological diseases, including ALS, stroke, and Parkinson's disease.

Due to its neuroprotective effects, creatine is now in clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and HD. 
 Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic factors, intermittent dopaminergic stimulation being one of the most important. 
 In studies of electromyographic (EMG) patterns during movements in Parkinson's disease, often a repetitive and sometimes co-contractive pattern of antagonist muscle activation is observed. 
A neural network model of Parkinson's disease, bradykinesia and rigidity, is extended to quantitatively study the conditions under which such a repetitive and co-contractive pattern of muscle activation appears. 
 The nonergot ligand pardoprunox (SLV308) is a dopamine (DA) D₂/D₃ and serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonist and a new candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Hence, this in vivo study suggests that pardoprunox represents a promising approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease on clinical grounds who subsequently turn out to have normal dopamine transporter imaging have been referred to as SWEDDs (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits). 
Despite having clinical features similar to those of Parkinson's disease, these patients seem to have different pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment requirements. 
In this study we determined the similarities and differences in the gaits of SWEDDs and Parkinson's disease patients to investigate whether walking patterns can distinguish these entities. 
We used 3-D motion capture to analyze the gaits of 11 SWEDDs patients (who had unilateral or asymmetric upper limb tremor with a rest component), 12 tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients, and 13 healthy control participants. 
In common with Parkinson's disease patients, SWEDDs patients had a slow gait mainly because of a small stride length, as well as a reduced arm swing. 
However, several abnormal features of posture and gait in Parkinson's disease were normal in SWEDDs. 
Thus, SWEDDs patients had normal trunk and elbow posture, normal stride length variability, and normal bilateral step-phase coordination, all of which were abnormal in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 The dopamine transporter knockout (DAT KO) mouse is a model of chronic hyperdopaminergia used to study a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug abuse, depression, and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Previous research has shown that allelic variations in three LMX1A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were related to risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that these SNPs may influence the number of mesencephalic DA neurons. 
We hypothesized that pramipexole, an agonist on D2/D3 receptors, may antagonize tinnitus in the presbycusis patients (in the frequency range of 250 to 8,000 Hz) in a dose schedule accepted for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in elderly people. 
CONCLUSIONS: Pramipexole is an effective agent against subjective tinnitus associated with presbycusis at a dose schedule used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The generation of dopamine (DA) neurons from stem cells holds great promise for future biomedical research and in the clinical treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Many studies have attempted to correlate changes of motor cortex activity with progression of Parkinson's disease, although results have been controversial. 
 Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta are defective in Parkinson's disease, but the specificity of this dysfunction is not understood. 
In addition, this capacity did not decline in either subpopulation with age, a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. 
 Dementia with Lewy-bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are no rare causes of dementia. 
Therefore low-dose clozapine treatment is acknowledged usual practise for psychosis in Parkinson's disease and a case report indicates efficacy for psychosis in DLB, too. 
All other atypical antipsychotics except risperidone are not licensed for dementia in Germany, but risperidone is contraindicated in DLB due to manufacturer's notice and usually not well tolerated in DLB and Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinsonism in DLB-patients responds worse to levodopa compared to patient with Parkinson's disease. 
A high number of preclinical studies on DA D(3) receptor antagonists have shown efficacy in animal models of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and drug dependence. 
As there is evidence for deregulation of glutamate metabolism in degenerative neurologic disorders, we sequenced GLUD1 and GLUD2 genes in neurologic patients and found that a rare T1492G variation in GLUD2 that results in substitution of Ala for Ser445 in the regulatory domain of hGDH2 interacted significantly with Parkinson's disease (PD) onset. 
 The organic pesticide rotenone is a neurotoxin suspected to cause Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms by selectively targeting and compromising the survival of dopaminergic neurons.

The impact of the regulatory action on the proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease prescribed cabergoline or pergolide was assessed by segmented regression analysis and by a statistical model of the rates of UCG examination in patients taking/not taking cabergoline or pergolide before and after the action. 
RESULTS: Of 574 patients with Parkinson's disease, the proportion of patients prescribed cabergoline or pergolide did not decrease but rather tended to increase after the action when analysed by segmented regression analysis (p = 0.13). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by selective and progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA)-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein. 
 Oxidative stress (OS) is thought to participate in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, but the contribution of dopamine metabolism and auto-oxidation to OS in Parkinson's and other diseases is not clear. 
Accordingly, compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggests that a profound rearrangement of the eCB system in the basal ganglia follows dopamine depletion, as it occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Disruption to different components of the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampal circuits leads to various psychiatric and neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia. 
 The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) are degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of alpha-synuclein (α-syn)-rich Lewy bodies in DA cells that remain. 
However, the effect of antiparkinson agents on plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels remains unknown in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Our results show the neuroprotective properties of GPA in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease are partially mediated by AMPK and mitochondrial function. 
The results remained nonsignificant after the inclusion of patient samples, namely schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease (four samples; all P > 0.18). 
Disruption of dopamine storage has been hypothesized to damage the dopamine neurons that are lost in Parkinson's disease. 
 Psychosis is a frequent nonmotor complication in Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by a broad phenomenology and likely due to a variety of intrinsic (i.e., PD-related) and extrinsic factors. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder of unknown etiology. 
 Chronic dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to deleterious motor sequelae known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). 
These actions underlie modulation of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and coordination of neural networks and provide intriguing target sites for pharmacological intervention in ischemia and Parkinson's disease. 
The actual use of adenosine or adenosine receptor ligands in ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia, panic disorder and anxiety, cocaine dependence and Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 1% of the global population aged 65 and older. 
 Post-mortem and neuroimaging studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown involvement of the brain serotoninergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic pathways alongside the characteristic degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. 
These cells possess a distinct physiology intrinsically associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production, and they selectively degenerate in Parkinson's disease under oxidative stress conditions. 
 Intrastriatal grafts of stem cell-derived dopamine (DA) neurons induce behavioral recovery in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), but how they functionally integrate in host neural circuitries is poorly understood. 
 BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that mutations in Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the cause of the most common inherited and some sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta followed by striatal dopamine depletion is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. 
 Adenosine A(2A) receptors (A2ARs) are thought to interact negatively with the dopamine D(2) receptor (D2R), so selective A2AR antagonists have attracted attention as novel treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterised by a profound and selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. 
In Parkinson's disease, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons involves motor structures including basal ganglia and cerebellum. 
Glutamate-mediated degeneration of the cerebellum contributes to motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

 INTRODUCTION: Functional neuroimaging techniques have greatly contributed to improving our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) neurodegeneration and related compensatory mechanisms. 
Parkinson's disease pathology leads to an exponential decline in nigrostriatal dopamine function and a compensatory increase in dopamine turnover, which may help delay symptom onset. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally viewed as a motor disorder with a characteristic triad of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. 
 Impulsive-compulsive behaviours are a significant source of morbidity for patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopaminergic therapy. 
Here, by using (11)C-raclopride positron emission tomography imaging, we investigated the effects of reward-related cues and L-dopa challenge in patients with Parkinson's disease with and without impulsive-compulsive behaviours on striatal levels of synaptic dopamine. 
There were no significant differences in baseline dopamine D2 receptor availability between the Parkinson's disease groups. 
No differences were found when comparing the percentage change of raclopride binding potential between the two Parkinson's disease groups following L-dopa challenge with neutral cues.

 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD), commonly defined as a hypokinetic movement disorder, is hampered by the appearance of motor complications (MC), including dyskinesias and motor fluctuations, and non-motor symptoms such as behavioral, neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders, which, in the last years, are gaining increasing attention. 
 Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is described as inappropriate and undesirable sleepiness during waking hours and is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease, affecting up to 50% of patients. 
EDS has a large impact on the quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients as well as of their caregivers, in some cases even more than the motor symptoms of the disease. 
Drug-induced EDS is a particular problem as many dopamine agonists used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease have EDS as an adverse effect. 
Dopaminergic treatment may also render a subset of Parkinson's disease patients at risk for sudden-onset sleep attacks that occur without warning and can be particularly hazardous if the patient is driving. 
There are many assessment tools for EDS, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), although only the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) and the SCales for Outcomes in PArkinson's Disease-Sleep (SCOPA-S) are specifically validated for Parkinson's disease.

 INTRODUCTION: Behavioral changes in Parkinson's disease are complex and their pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. 
The dopaminergic system seems to play a major role and most of the behavioral disorders in Parkinson's disease can be classified into either hypodopaminergic if related to the disease itself or hyperdopaminergic if related to dopaminergic treatment. 
Such a study has shown that apathy, which is the most frequent behavioral problem in Parkinson's disease, is part of a much broader hypodopaminergic behavioral syndrome which also includes anxiety and depression. 
 Because methamphetamine exposure to experimental animals can damage brain dopamine neurones, we examined whether hospital patients diagnosed with methamphetamine-related disorders might have greater risk of subsequent admission with a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. 
The appendicitis group had a Parkinson's disease incidence rate no different than the rate found among members of a large health maintenance organization in California. 
Cox regression procedures were used to estimate group differences in the rates of receiving a subsequent inpatient diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (ICD-9 332.0). 
The methamphetamine group showed increased risk of a subsequent admission with Parkinson's disease compared with that of the matched appendicitis group (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.17-5.98, P= 0.019). 
Study limitations include a population limited to hospital admissions, an uncertainty regarding diagnostic validity of the ICD-9 code 332.0 (Parkinson's disease), and a small number of incident cases with suspected Parkinson's disease. 
Nevertheless, these data, requiring replication, provide some evidence that methamphetamine users might be at greater than normal risk for developing Parkinson's disease.

We now show that in the striatum of these mice, as in Parkinson's disease, synaptic accumulation of alpha-synuclein is accompanied by an age-dependent redistribution of the synaptic SNARE proteins SNAP-25, syntaxin-1 and synaptobrevin-2, as well as by an age-dependent reduction in dopamine release. 
These findings reveal a novel gain of toxic function of alpha-synuclein at the synapse, which may be an early event in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Despite the widespread use of mice as models of Parkinson's disease there is a surprising lack of validation and characterisation of unilateral lesion models in mice and the extent of behavioural impairments induced by such lesions.

 The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) is high and can potentially occur as the result of multiple differing pathologies. 
Findings of increased Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) binding in subjects with Lewy Body Disease (LBD) compared with Parkinson's disease and dementia (PDD) may explain phenotype differences in the spectrum of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and show promise in guiding future therapeutic trials aimed at this disease. 
 The classical animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) rely on the use of neurotoxins, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 6-hydroxydopamine and, more recently, the agricultural chemicals paraquat and rotenone, to deplete dopamine (DA). 
We will provide an overview of the current understanding of the neurobiology underlying ICDs in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The last few years have seen an increase in the number of studies using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) along with receptor imaging and regional cerebral blood flow Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In addition, recent studies have revealed new insights into the therapeutic role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in treating various CNS disorders, including not only depressive disorders (e.g., delayed onset of action and refractory symptoms), but also schizophrenia (e.g., cognitive impairment and antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal side effects) and Parkinson's disease (e.g., extrapyramidal motor symptoms and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia). 
 Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 'sleep attacks', insomnia, restless legs syndrome and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, are common and provide a challenge to treatment. 
 Disorders of initiation and maintenance of sleep (DIMS), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are common and clinically significant in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Oxidative damage is thought to be a major cause of the progression of dopamine (DA)rgic neurodegeneration as in Parkinson's disease. 
 Neurodegeneration is one of the primary etiologies in the onset of Parkinson's disease. 
 Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are a set of behaviours that take place in a subgroup of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a complex, multifactorial aetiology. 
In China the data show that the incidence of Parkinson's disease increases at least 20 times in recent 20 years, and it makes things worse for the aging society. 
 Long-term dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease leads to the development of disabling involuntary movements named dyskinesias that are related to adaptive changes in striatal signaling pathways. 
These findings demonstrate that the increase of striatal DeltaFosB in the evolution of chronically treated Parkinson's disease may be a trigger for the development of abnormal responsiveness to dopamine and the emergence of involuntary movements. 
To explore the mechanisms underlying the action of Cdk5 in the development of LID, we examined the impact of treatment with Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, on the severity of LID in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by 6-OHDA. 
 This study was designed to follow the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of rasagiline for Parkinson's disease (PD) with data collected from all patients who had ever taken rasagiline during the 12-month TEMPO monotherapy trial (N = 398) and subsequent open-label extension. 
It is widely used for the suppression of lactation, the treatment of prolactinomas and the management of Parkinson's disease. 
 Both Parkinson's disease and its treatment can be associated with psychiatric symptoms. 
The addition of zonisamide at 25-50 mg/day to currently used antiparkinsonian drugs significantly improved cardinal symptoms in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Zonisamide has multiple modes of action, and its effects on Parkinson's disease include activation of dopamine synthesis, inhibition of monoamine oxidase, inhibition of T-type calcium channels and inhibition of an indirect pathway in the basal ganglia through the δ opioid receptor. 
Furthermore, zonisamide exhibits neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

We have previously shown that both patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals with low dopamine (DA) synthesis are better at reversal learning based on punishment than reward. 
Such gender biases may go some way towards explaining the gender biases in certain psychiatric disorders such as depression and Parkinson's disease. 
 Current therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD) provide symptomatic relief but none of them change the course of disease.

 Monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) are currently the best animal model for Parkinson's disease (PD) and have been widely used for physiological and pharmacological investigations. 
 BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists (DAs), long used in treating Parkinson's disease and effective in relieving symptoms of restless legs syndrome, have frequently been reported to induce problematic compulsive behaviors (e.g., obsessive gambling, hypersexuality) in individuals who had never had difficulties with such behaviors before. 
These interneurons are likely to play an important role in striatal function through fast GABAergic synaptic transmission in addition to, and independent of, their potential role in compensation for dopamine loss in experimental or idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 The mechanisms underlying neuron death in Parkinson's disease are unknown, but both genetic defects and environmental factors are implicated in its pathogenesis. 
Taken together, our results demonstrate an important function of parkin in the protection against redox-active metals and pesticides implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease.

 BACKGROUND: Following cued levodopa (LD) intake, endurance exercise showed a beneficial effect on scored motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in comparison with rest. 
 Many experiments support the notion that augmentation of neurotrophic factors' (NTFs) activity, especially glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could prevent or halt the progress of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This article discusses the treatment modalities for the management of patients with a prolactinoma, Cushing's disease and acromegaly, and summarizes the options for medical therapy in these patients.First-line treatment of prolactinomas is pharmacotherapy with dopamine agonists; recent reports of cardiac valve abnormalities associated with this class of medication in Parkinson's disease has prompted study in hyperprolactinemic populations. 
 Dopamine is cytotoxic and may play a role in the development of Parkinson's disease.

Of the two patients with bradykinesia, DAT density was reduced to the Parkinson's disease (PD) range with a rostrocaudal gradient typical of PD in one patient (CAG repeats 13/22) and was mildly decreased in the other patient (12/25). 
 Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the resulting decrease in striatal dopamine levels are the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. 
 Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. 
Collectively, our findings show that LRRK2 plays an essential and unexpected role in the regulation of protein homeostasis during aging, and suggest that LRRK2 mutations may cause Parkinson's disease and cell death via impairment of protein degradation pathways, leading to alpha-synuclein accumulation and aggregation over time. 
In one patient, striatal [(123)I]FP-CIT uptake was reduced, similar to the pattern of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Depression is common in patients with Parkinson's disease, but evidence on the efficacy of antidepressants in this population is lacking. 
Because depression in patients with Parkinson's disease might be related to dopaminergic dysfunction, we aimed to assess the efficacy of the dopamine agonist pramipexole for treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: We did a 12-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled (1:1 ratio) trial of pramipexole (0.125-1.0 mg three times per day) compared with placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. 
Patients from 76 centres in 12 European countries and South Africa were included if they were on stable antiparkinsonian therapy without motor fluctuations and had depressive symptoms (15-item geriatric depression scale score > or =5 and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale [UPDRS] part 1 depression item score > or =2). 
INTERPRETATION: Pramipexole improved depressive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease, mainly through a direct antidepressant effect. 
This effect should be considered in the clinical management of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
 Cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) using neural stem cells to replace the lost dopamine neurons is currently an intense area of research. 
 A nonionic surfactant MEKC method with LIF detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of memantine, an anti-Alzheimer's disease agent, and amantadine, an anti-Parkinson's disease drug, in human plasma. 
This method was applied successfully to monitor the concentration of memantine or amantadine in patients with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.

 Rasagiline is a selective, monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor indicated for treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Lastly, we discuss the abuse potential of the dopaminergic agents, apomorphine and levodopa, in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
It is proposed that, for this patient, the mechanism of maladaptive gambling behaviour was the development of a routine behaviour related to the patient's cognitive inertia, a mechanism different from the changes in reward sensitivity observed after damage to the orbital ventral prefrontal-ventral striatum system or in dopamine dysregulation syndrome in Parkinson's disease. 
 The open 6-month study (the MIRAG study) on the effect of D2/D3 dopamine agonist pramipexole (mirapex) on tremor, affective disorders and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was carried out.

 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a high risk of psychiatric complications, like depressive or psychotic syndromes, dementia and sleep disorders. 
 Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders associated to changes in alpha-synuclein often result in autonomic dysfunction, most of the time accompanied by abundant expression of this synaptic protein in peripheral autonomic neurons. 
 Antagonists selectively inhibiting activation of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor reduce motor symptoms in experimental models of Parkinson's disease, and genetic deletion of the ppN/OFQ gene offers partial protection of mid-brain dopamine neurons against the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 
These results demonstrate that increased N/OFQ expression in the SNr is closely associated with the MPTP-induced loss of dopamine neurons in the SNc in a widely used animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an efficacious treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease, yet the mechanisms of STN DBS remain poorly understood. 
 Parkinson's disease is caused primarily by degeneration of brain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the consequent deficit of dopamine in the striatum. 
We found that dyskinesia is attenuated by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of GRK6 in the striatum in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease. 
Our finding that increased availability of GRK6 ameliorates dyskinesia and increases duration of the antiparkinsonian action of l-dopa suggests a promising approach for controlling both dyskinesia and motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
ZNS was added after doses of the anti-Parkinson's disease drugs were fixed for at least 4 weeks. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
The immune system also participates in proliferation of neural progenitor stem cells and their migration to sites of injury and this activity has been documented in various neurologic disorders including traumatic injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, multiple sclerosis, infection, and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS). 
 The neuroprotective effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were reported in several neurological disease models, including Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the selective loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. 
alpha-Synuclein has a causal role in Parkinson's disease, and could interfere with transcriptional regulation of dopamine neurons.

We seek to elucidate the structural basis and molecular mechanism by which PLG and its analogues modulate dopamine receptors, toward the development of new therapeutics to treat Parkinson's disease, tardive dyskinesia and schizophrenia. 
 BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or Parkinsonian syndromes often report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). 
 The Staircase test measures lateralised deficits in skilled paw reaching in rodents, and there is a long-standing discrepancy in the literature on whether the paradigm is sensitive to graft-mediated functional recovery in the rodent model of Parkinson's disease. 
The major focus of clinical staging in the present account stems from the fundamental notions of Braak staging as they describe the course and eventual prognosis for Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body dementia, and Parkinson's disease. 
 Clinically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the development of tremors and rigidity that is found primarily in patients over the age of 50. 
 The role of the ATP-gated receptor, P2X(7), has been evaluated in the unilateral 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease using the P2X(7) competitive antagonist A-438079. 
Blockade of P2X(7) receptors may represent a novel protective strategy for striatal DA terminals in Parkinson's disease and warrants further future investigation. 
 Levodopa, a prodrug of dopamine, is the first line drug in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Hyposmia is an early symptom of idiopathic Parkinson's disease but the pathological bases of such dysfunction are largely unknown. 
The distribution of alpha-synuclein, which forms Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the types of neurons (based on their neurotransmitters) affected by alpha-synucleinopathy were investigated in the olfactory system in Parkinson's disease. 
Immunohistochemical distribution of alpha-synuclein and its co-localization with tyrosine hydroxylase, somatostatin, calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin and substance P in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle and piriform, periamygdaloid and rostral entorhinal cortices of idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases (n = 11) and age-matched controls (n = 11) were investigated. 
 Mutations in LRRK2 are thus far the most frequent known cause of autosomal dominant and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with prevalent mutations being found within the GTPase (R1441C/G) and kinase (G2019S) domains. 
In the present study, we investigated whether cysteamine confers protection against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP)-induced toxicity in the dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine D2/3 receptor agonists have been widely used to treat motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are also reported to improve cognitive and emotional disturbances. 
 The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are commonly attributed to striatal dopamine loss, but reduced dopamine innervation of basal ganglia output nuclei, the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) may also contribute to symptoms and signs of PD. 
This so-called interference effect was reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and their respective forebrain and cortical target areas are well established as serving a critical role in mediating voluntary motor control, as evidenced in Parkinson's disease, and incentive-motivated behaviors and cognitive functions, as exhibited in drug addiction and schizophrenia, respectively. 
 Temporal variation in the motor function of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suggests the potential importance of a chronobiological and chronopharmacological approach in its clinical management. 
 Rats lesioned shortly after birth with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 134 μg icv) represent a near-ideal model of severe Parkinson's disease because of the near-total destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers. 
The element manganese, an essential cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, itself in toxic amount, replicates some clinical features similar to those of Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of neonatal manganese exposure on 6-OHDA modeling of Parkinson's disease in rats. 
 The pesticide paraquat (PQ) was found to be a suitable xenobiotic to model Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease, degeneration of specific neurons in the midbrain can cause severe motor deficits, including tremors and the inability to initiate movement. 
To investigate gene therapy for Parkinson's disease, we simulated the disease in macaque monkeys by treating them with the complex I mitochondrial inhibitor 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which induces selective degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. 
 The role of electro-acupuncture (EA) stimulation on motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well studied. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
 Following initial diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, if it were possible to prescribe a treatment that could halt or prevent further neurodegeneration, disease progression could be prevented. 
Abnormalities in mitochondria, proteasome and lysosome function, as well as oxidative stress cause cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
We propose that exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to different toxins that recapitulate cell death mechanisms in Parkinson's disease serves as a rapid and reliable method to test neuroprotective agents that may succeed in clinical trials. 
The findings demonstrate restorative effects of 9-methyl-beta-carboline in an animal model of Parkinson's disease that improve the effectiveness of the respiratory chain and promote the transcription and expression of neurotrophin-related genes. 
 Dopamine receptor agonists provide a viable alternative or adjunct to levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease and are associated with fewer motor complications and dyskinesia. 
In many cases, these adverse effects amplify non-motor symptoms that people with Parkinson's disease may already be experiencing. 
Care must be taken to educate patients with Parkinson's disease about the common adverse effects of dopamine agonists and what can be done to lessen them. 
 Phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 gene mutations have been associated with autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease. 
To date, no neuropathological reports have been published from patients with Parkinson's disease with both phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 gene copies mutated. 
Single photon emission computed tomography quantification of striatal dopamine transporter binding (123I-Ioflupane) revealed a posterior-anterior gradient similar to that of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but there was no correlation between striatal reduced uptake and disease duration. 
Post-mortem neuropathological examination of an early-onset Parkinson's disease carrier of two heterozygous compound phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 mutations showed neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, Lewy bodies and aberrant neurites in the reticular nuclei of the brainstem, substantia nigra pars compacta and Meynert nucleus, but the locus ceruleus and the amygdala were spared. 
Unbalanced preservation of the locus ceruleus may well play a role in the slow evolution of motor symptoms and, probably, in the psychiatric symptoms often encountered in Parkinson's disease associated with phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 mutation. 
 The recent development of viral vectors, especially vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV), has translated gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) from animal experiments into clinical trials.

The correlation between reduced striatal dopaminergic (DA) function, SAD motor symptoms and the high occurrence of SAD in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), suggests a link between SAD and movement diseases caused by dopamine dysfunction. 
Estrogen administration has been demonstrated to provide protection in several animal models of CNS disorders, including stroke, brain injury, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, age-related cognitive decline and multiple sclerosis. 
 Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) ameliorates motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but the precise mechanism is still unknown. 
As a consequence, additional characterization of these heterodimers led to new aspects on the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, drug addiction, and l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias relevant for their treatments. 
Genetically slow CYP2D6 metabolizers are at higher risk for developing Parkinson's disease, a risk that increases with exposure to pesticides. 
These data further support a possible role for CYP2D6 in neuroprotection from Parkinson's disease-causing neurotoxins, especially in the human brain where expression of CYP2D6 is high in some regions (e.g. 
 Therapeutic options for Parkinson's disease (PD) are currently limited to symptomatic agents. 
 Early treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) affords an opportunity to forestall clinical progression. 
 Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular alpha-synuclein (eSNCA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies by inducing neurotoxicity directly or indirectly via microglial or astroglial activation. 
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of bipolar disorder, dopamine dysregulation syndrome and punding in Parkinson's disease patients from a Brazilian movement disorders clinic. 
RESULTS: We identified, respectively, one and five Parkinson's disease patients with bipolar disorder type I and type II. 
All manic/hypomanic episodes occurred before Parkinson's disease onset. 
CONCLUSION: The frequency of manic/hypomanic episodes seems to decrease with Parkinson's disease onset, and local environmental factors (e.g. 
drug availability) may be responsible for the low frequency of dopamine dysregulation syndrome and punding in Brazilian Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) involves a progressive depletion of dopamine in the basal ganglia leading to motor alterations.

 Pathological gambling (PG) represents a behavioral side effect of dopamine replacement therapy in a minority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The present study examines the changes in the rhythm of F0 in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as well as in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) after being orally administered with dopamine. 
 BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
It is reported that KD can provide the neuroprotection for the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
 Levodopa-induced motor complications, including dyskinesia and wearing off, are troublesome side effects of treatment and impair quality of life in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 Inclusions of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in dopaminergic neurons are a characteristic histological marker of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Current challenges related to the management of prolactinomas remain in the recurrence of the disease after withdrawal of dopamine agonists, the potential of increased risk of cardiac valvulopathy, which is observed in patients treated with high-dose cabergoline for Parkinson's disease, the effects of pregnancy, and impaired quality of life associated with pituitary adenomas in general, and prolactinomas in particular. 
 Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is efficacious in treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SNDA neurons) are among the most severely affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Initiation and progression of Parkinson's disease seem to be linked to oxidative stress, closely related to decreased mitochondrial functions and ubiquitin proteasome system dysfunction. 
Recently, several dual acting drugs, in which L-Dopa/dopamine are covalently linked to antioxidant molecules, were shown to induce sustained delivery of both L-Dopa/dopamine in rat plasma and striatum, suggesting that these compounds might be proposed as useful agents against Parkinson's disease. 
Moreover, by using proteasome inhibitor-treated mice as Parkinson's disease animal model, we demonstrated the beneficial effects of the systemic administration of this novel codrug. 
 BACKGROUND: Neurotrophic factors, such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), have shown great promise for protection and restoration of damaged or dying dopamine neurons in animal models and in some Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical trials. 
The clinical spectrum of psychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is very wide, including symptoms of depression and anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, with prevalent paranoid symptoms, agitation, delirium and sleep disorders. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease experience motor and perceptual timing difficulties, which are ameliorated by dopaminergic medication. 
We investigated the neural correlates of motor timing in Parkinson's disease, including the effects of dopaminergic medication on patterns of brain activation. 
Eight patients with Parkinson's disease and eight healthy controls were scanned with H(15)(2)O positron emission tomography while engaged in three tasks: synchronization (right index finger tapping in synchrony with a tone presented at 1 Hz), continuation (tapping at 1 Hz in the absence of a tone), and a control simple reaction time task. 
Relative to the externally-paced synchronization task, the internally controlled continuation task was associated with greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 46/9) in both the control and Parkinson's disease groups. 
These results suggest that in Parkinson's disease, in the 'OFF' medication state, excessive inhibitory pallidal outflow is associated with a lack of adequate frontal activation and reliance on the cerebellum for motor timing. 
These data suggest that the effects of l-DOPA in Parkinson's disease may result from actions of its metabolites dopamine and 3-MT on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic receptors. 
It has been suggested that their impairment could account for the onset and progression of motor symptoms of PD (Parkinson's disease), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the massive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the striatum. 
 Pramipexole extended release (ER) is a non-ergolinic dopamine receptor agonist available for use as a once-daily oral treatment for the signs and symptoms of early and advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Pramipexole ER improved the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in three well designed trials in adults with early or advanced disease, as measured by changes from baseline in the sum of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts II and III subtotal scores. 
In a 9-week study, the majority of patients with early Parkinson's disease who were receiving stable pramipexole IR treatment were successfully switched to pramipexole ER. 
Relative to placebo at week 18, pramipexole ER 0.375-4.5 mg (of the salt) once daily significantly decreased the sum of the UPDRS parts II and III subtotal scores from baseline in two trials in patients with early or advanced Parkinson's disease, and also reduced the percentage of off-time during waking hours in patients with advanced disease. 
The efficacy of pramipexole ER was maintained after 33 weeks of treatment in the trials in patients with early or advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Pramipexole ER was generally well tolerated in patients with Parkinson's disease, with the rate of adverse events being generally similar to that with pramipexole IR. 
 Apathy has been reported to occur after subthalamic nucleus stimulation, a treatment of motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
In 63 patients with Parkinson's disease treated with subthalamic stimulation, dopaminergic treatment was decreased by 82% after surgery.

 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is well known as an exogenous dopaminergic neurotoxin that induces Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. 
In addition, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) derivatives have been investigated as endogenous MPTP mimetic compounds that structurally resemble selegiline, a commercially available drug for treating Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study, we examined the ability of 1,3-dimethyl-TIQ (1,3-diMeTIQ) and 1,3-dimethyl-N-propargyl-TIQ (1,3-diMe-N-proTIQ) to prevent MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in mice and to prevent 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+, an active metabolite of MPTP)-induced cytotoxicity in vitro, including its structural stereoselectivity. 
On the other hand, 1,3-diMe-N-proTIQ prevented these Parkinson's disease-like symptoms; in particular, the trans-isomer of this agent showed potent protective effects.

 Based on the observation that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease was mediated by the release of endogenous dopamine in both the dorsal and ventral striatum, in 2002 we formally proposed the placebo-reward hypothesis. 
In keeping with this prediction, functional neuroimaging studies have shown placebo-induced activation of the reward circuitry in Parkinson's disease, depression, and pain.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a dramatic loss of dopamine that underlies complex structural and functional changes in striatal projection neurons. 
 One of the most marked differences to be identified in Parkinson's disease is the change in activity of thalamic neurons in the motor circuits. 
However, there is considerable evidence that pathology in the thalamus itself contributes to the abnormal neural activity characteristic of Parkinson's disease. 
In a series of studies examining the degree of degeneration in the thalamus, we have observed selective degeneration in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in patients with levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease. 
There is 30-40% loss in this region of the thalamus in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with non-parvalbumin-containing neurons degenerating the most (70% average loss). 
Our recent work suggests that the preservation of this pathway may contribute to dystonia in Parkinson's disease.

However, the relevance of these trace amines in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is still largely unknown. 
These findings raise the possibility that Parkinson's disease is firstly characterized by abnormalities of tyrosine decarboxylase, rather than tyrosine hydroxylase, enzyme activity. 
Given the role of this enzyme in the production of trace amines, circulating octopamine levels may hold promise as a biomarker of early Parkinson's disease. 
 L-Dopa treatment, the gold standard therapy for Parkinson's disease, is hampered by motor complications such as dyskinesias.

 INTRODUCTION: To investigate the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD), a three-phase study was conducted. 
Early Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly characterized by dopaminergic denervation of the dorsal and posterior striatum while sparing anterior and ventral regions. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting voluntary motor control. 
In Parkinson's disease, Nurr1 expression is diminished and mutations in the Nurr1 gene have been identified in rare cases of disease; however, the significance of these observations remains unclear. 
As in Parkinson's disease, neurons of the substantia nigra compacta were more vulnerable than cells in the ventral tegmental area when Nurr1 was ablated at late embryogenesis. 
 Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common known cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In summary, agonist-induced modulation of CB(1)-D(2L) oligomerization may have physiological implications in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of motor system disorder that results from the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of the midbrain. 
Recent studies reported cardiac valve regurgitations in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with high doses of DA, raising concerns about the safety of cabergoline in patients with hyperprolactinemia. 
 Cell therapy using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is a promising therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease (PD), an incurable neurodegenerative disease. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are often impaired when performing motor acts and in the acquisition of new motor skills. 
 Loss of dopamine from the striatum can cause both profound motor deficits, as in Parkinson's disease, and disrupt learning. 
 We have previously reported the results of a 1-y double-blind, placebo-controlled study of embryonic dopamine cell implantation for Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN, A9) are particularly vulnerable, compared to adjacent DA neurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA, A10). 
 Ca(v)1.3 (alpha 1D) L-type Ca(2+) channels have been implicated in substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neuron pacemaking and vulnerability to Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is possible that tonic increase of dopamine associated with levodopa medication overshadows phasic release of dopamine, which is essential for learning. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral midbrain (vMB) and results in severely disturbed regulation of movement. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) results from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the consequent deficit of dopamine released in the striatum. 
 The MitoPark mouse, in which the mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam is selectively removed in midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, is a genetic model for Parkinson's disease (PD) that replicates the slow and progressive development of key symptoms. 
 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic acid (HVA) concentrations and nigrostriatal dopaminergic function assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with carbon-11-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane ((11)C-CFT), which can measure the dopamine transporter (DAT) density, in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's disease, and the most common movement disorder. 
These were monitored in their effects on stem cell survival and differentiation, rescue of endogenous dopaminergic neurons and ability to influence functional recovery after transplantation in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, L1 overexpressing stem cell-derived neural aggregates enhance survival and migration of transplanted cells, differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, survival of endogenous dopaminergic neurons, and functional recovery after syngeneic transplantation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease. 
 We investigated the role of dopamine in working memory by examining effects of withdrawing dopaminergic medication in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Resistance to distraction during a delayed response task was abnormally enhanced in Parkinson's disease patients OFF medication relative to controls. 
Conversely, performance on a backward digit span test was impaired in these same Parkinson's disease patients OFF medication. 
Dopaminergic medication reinstated susceptibility to distraction and backward digit span performance, so that performance of Parkinson's disease patients ON medication did not differ from that of controls. 
We hypothesize that the enhanced distractor resistance and impaired backward digit span in Parkinson's disease reflects low dopamine levels in the striatum, and perhaps upregulated frontal dopamine levels. 
 An in vitro model of mitochondrial dysfunction with subsequent oxidative stress was elaborated and utilized to study the effect of drugs, currently used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, on pathological H(2)O(2)-evoked [(3)H]dopamine efflux and the formation of toxic dopamine metabolites in rat striatal slices. 
 Since the introduction of levodopa therapy and dopaminergic replacement therapy to abate symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, repetitive compulsive behaviors have been reported and are now considered to be drug-related response complications. 
 Anti-inflammatory strategies receive growing attention for their potential to prevent pathological deterioration in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which is accompanied by inflammatory reactions that might play a critical role in the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is not clear despite its frequent association with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, although mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in the mechanisms associated with PD pathogenesis.

 Deep brain stimulation (DBS), an effective neurosurgical therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), may act via eliciting neurotransmitter release. 
 The ability to isolate ventral midbrain (VM) precursor cells and neurons provides a powerful means to characterize their differentiation properties and to study their potential for restoring dopamine (DA) neurons degenerated in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a progressive loss of neuromelanin (NM)-containing dopamine neurons in substantia nigra (SN) which is associated with microgliosis and presence of extracellular NM. 
Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, neurons hypothesized to play a role in reinforcement learning. 
We also found a novel dopamine-dependent effect on decision making that is not accounted for by reinforcement learning models: perseveration in choice, independent of reward history, increases with Parkinson's disease and decreases with dopamine therapy. 
In Parkinson's disease, the spontaneous firing pattern of GPi/SNpr neurons is abnormal due to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. 
In a previous study, we found that systemically administered vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was effective at reversing the motor deficits (but not the decline in striatal dopamine levels) in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) exposure). 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. 
Nonmotor features, such as cognitive impairment, mood disorders, autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal and genitourinary dysfunction, have a substantial impact on Parkinson's disease patients and their quality of life. 
This review will provide an overview on medications currently available for management of both motor and nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Focus will be placed on recent and evolving studies evaluating symptomatic and neuroprotective effects of medications, and how such studies may impact the future management of Parkinson's disease. 
 Anxiety has been less extensively studied than depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Our results suggest that the changes in rate and entrainment to the LFP observed in medium spiny neurons after dopamine depletion are somewhat dissociable, and that lack of D1- or D2-type receptor activation can exert independent yet interactive pathological effects during the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 Zonisamide is an FDA-approved antiepileptic drug that blocks voltage-dependent Na(+) channels and T-type Ca(2+) channels and improves clinical outcome in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients when used as an adjunct to other PD therapies. 
 Synchronized oscillatory neuronal activity in the beta frequency range has been observed in the basal ganglia of Parkinson's disease patients and hypothesized to be antikinetic. 
The unilaterally lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease allows examination of this hypothesis by direct comparison of beta activity in basal ganglia output in non-lesioned and dopamine cell lesioned hemispheres during motor activity. 
These experimental results offer further evidence that MSCs are a promising candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Rotigotine is a highly lipophilic dopamine-receptor agonist and the first transdermally delivered agent to demonstrate efficacy and safety as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and to reduce "off" hours in levodopa-treated patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
In early Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 8 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy to ropinirole (at doses up to 12 mg/day); in advanced Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 16 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy and tolerability to pramipexole (at doses up to 4.5 mg/day). 
In the registration trials for early and advanced Parkinson's disease, the adverse effects most commonly observed with rotigotine were minor application site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence. 
The transdermal delivery system is also an advantage when nonoral administration is desired, and the 24-hour, continuous, nonfluctuating drug levels can improve early morning and nocturnal symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
This review summarizes the key pharmacologic and clinical data for rotigotine and provides a focused clinical context for its use in early-to-advanced Parkinson's disease, as well as a brief summary for its role in restless legs syndrome. 
Despite recent efforts to introduce this nucleus as a potential target for deep brain stimulation to treat motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease; and the well-known antiparkinsonian effects of anticholinergic drugs; the cholinergic influence on somatodendritic dopamine release is not well understood. 
The results indicate that muscarinic activity in the substantia nigra is of functional importance in an animal Parkinson's disease model, and strengthen the notion that nigral dopaminergic regulation of motor activity/performance is independent of striatal dopamine release. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. 
We discuss the possible relevance of some putative D(2) receptor heteromers in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, respectively.

 We tested the hypothesis that long-term l-DOPA treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) would result in increased production of the dopamine oxidation product, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the striatum. 
 Parkinson's disease was long considered a non-hereditary disorder. 
Since a number of genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis it seems likely that several molecular pathways and downstream effectors can affect the trophic support and/or the survival of dopamine neurons, subsequently leading to Parkinson's disease. 
The review also describes the current status of the most common genetic susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease identified up to today. 
 A clinically-related animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) may enable the elucidation of the etiology of the disease and assist the development of medications. 
Emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to trichloroethylene may contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease. 
Overall, our animal model exhibits some important features of Parkinsonism, and further supports that trichloroethylene may be an environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease. 
 Several studies have found that Parkinson's disease (PD) disrupts the organization of complex motor sequences regardless of the influence of parkinsonian medications. 
 BACKGROUND: There is ample evidence that a subgroup of Parkinson's disease patients who are treated with dopaminergic drugs develop certain behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling. 
They may have implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients by offering a genotype approach for determining individual susceptibilities for pathological gambling and may also afford insights into the vulnerability mechanisms underlying addictive behavior. 
 Early phases of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by a mild reduction of dopamine (DA) in striatum and by emergence of psychiatric disturbances that precede overt motor symptoms. 
 Preclinical data suggest that cystamine stands as a promising neuroprotective agent against Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases. 
Taken together, these results strengthen the neuroprotective potential of cystamine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and point towards the up-regulation of BDNF as an important mechanism of action. 
 Retroperitoneal fibrosis is best described as a chronic inflammatory process which may be idiopathic, but can rarely be brought about by medications, such as pergolide, used for treating Parkinson's disease. 
Herein we describe the case of a 68-year-old man who received pergolide for 2 years for Parkinson's disease. 
This is the second case reported in the literature, of a patient who had double valve and ascending aorta replacement surgery because he suffered from this rare but serious adverse effect of dopamine agonists used for managing Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease is an archetypal disorder of dopamine dysfunction characterised by motor, cognitive, behavioural, and autonomic symptoms. 
 A dopaminergic deficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) causes abnormalities of movement, behaviour, learning, and emotions. 
 Impulsivity may be induced by therapeutic interventions (dopamine replacement therapies and sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Psychotic symptoms occur in up to 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Here, we show that the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), a brain region where dopamine (DA) cell degeneration leads to Parkinson's disease (PD), expresses GHSR. 
 Alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions, pathological hallmarks of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and it is assumed to be aetiologically involved in these conditions. 
We compared membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein, both the full-length 17 kDa and high molecular weight species, by western blotting in autopsied brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (brainstem-predominant Lewy body disease: n = 9), multiple system atrophy (n = 11), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 16), and of normal controls (n = 13). 
In both Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein levels were normal in putamen and frontal cortex whereas a trend was observed for variably increased 17 kDa membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein concentrations [+184% (-60% to +618%)] with additional high molecular weight species in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra. 
No obvious correlation was observed between nigral membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulation and Lewy body density in Parkinson's disease. 
Several Parkinson's disease patients had very modest high molecular weight membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulation in putamen. 
Brain membrane-associated, sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble alpha-synuclein accumulations in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are regionally specific, suggesting that these sporadic alpha-synucleinopathies, unlike familial Parkinsonism-dementia, are not associated with a simple global over-expression of the protein. 
Literature discrepancies on alpha-synuclein status in 'Parkinson's disease' might be explained by inclusion of cases not having classic brainstem-predominant Lewy body disease and by variable alpha-synuclein accumulation within this diagnostic classification. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and by the appearance of Lewy bodies. 
 The gold standard therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) consists in chronic administration of pulses of the dopamine (DA) precursor l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). 
The development of new genetic and optical tools has pushed this field forward in the last couple of years, demanding a re-evaluation of models of how experience controls dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity and how disease states like Parkinson's disease affect the striatal circuitry. 
In addition, changes in the expression of DA receptors and their signaling pathways especially in T cells are associated with altered immune functions in disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
The PTEN-induced kinase 1 gene (PINK1) is responsible for recessive inherited familial Parkinson's disease (PARK6). 
Neither the function of PINK1 nor its role in the prevention of Parkinson's disease is fully understood. 
 alpha-Synuclein is a major component of filamentous inclusions that are histological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies. 
Moreover, these findings not only shed light on the understanding of manganese neurotoxicity but may also bear relevance to the potentially multifactorial etiology of Parkinson's disease. 
 L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is characterised by debilitating involuntary movement, which limits quality of life in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
 The potential value of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) remains controversial. 
Tremor: Descriptions of tremors progressed from Galen's definition in the 2nd century; to Galileo's physiologic tremor in 1610; separation of involuntary movements during action and at rest in the 17th and 18th centuries by de la Boë Sylvius and van Sweiten; description of Parkinson's disease by Parkinson, discrimination of the rest tremor of Parkinson's disease from the intention tremor of multiple sclerosis by Charcot, and recognition of familial action tremors by Dana and others in the late 19th century; and recognition of autosomal dominant essential tremor in the mid-20th century. 
Parkinsonism: Pathologic changes in Parkinson's disease were recognized in the substantia nigra by Blocq and Marinescu in the late 19th century, and around 1920 Trértiakoff established Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra as a pathologic hallmark while the Vogts instead emphasized pathologic changes in the striatum; it was only in the mid-1960s that a nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway was demonstrated and found to be critical to pathogenesis. 
Later progress in understanding and treating Parkinson's disease included recognition of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism beginning in the 1950s, development of dopamine agonists and elaboration of different dopamine receptors beginning in the 1960s, recognition of MPTP-induced parkinsonism in 1982 and subsequent development of experimental models of MPTP-induced parkinsonism. 
Since 1990, rare genetic forms of Parkinson's disease were discovered, which accelerated progress in understanding pathogenesis, and established roles for alpha synuclein and the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system. 
Wilson's disease, multisystem atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration) from Parkinson's disease in the 20th century also led to important discoveries of basal ganglia function, and in the case of Wilson's disease to recognition of genetic mutations and effective treatments. 
 Few cases of dopamine agonist-induced antecollis in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported. 
 Levodopa is the main medication used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
We have reported the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor selegiline to be effective for treating motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease model rats. 
We analyzed the improvement in motor functions and catecholamine contents in various brain regions induced by a combination of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone and a levodopa/dopadecarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) induced Parkinson's disease model rats. 
The motor functions in the Parkinson's disease model rats were significantly recovered to the same levels as the healthy control rats by the combined administration of entacapone and levodopa/DDCI. 
Thus, COMT inhibitors are useful for decreasing the amount of levodopa administered to Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Parkinson's disease affects more than 1% of individuals older than 60 years of age. 
No effective neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease is yet available, and there is currently substantial interest in the development of new nondopaminergic agents. 
 Pathological and neuroimaging studies have shown that in Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a "subclinical" or "premotor" period during which dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) degenerate but typical motor symptoms have not yet developed. 
 INTRODUCTION: The cardinal pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
 Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands (GDFLs) as well as other trophic factors have, in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), demonstrated the potential for excellent ameliorative properties. 
 Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the extrapyramidal system resulting from the deficiency of dopamine in the basal ganglia. 
We experienced the perioperative management of a patient with Parkinson's disease with intravenous infusion of levodopa, precursor of which is dopamine. 
She did not show deterioration of her symptom of Parkinson's disease, and develop any complications during the perioperative period. 
We need to manage Parkinson's disease with intravenous infusion of levodopa during the perioperative period, taking care of the symptom of Parkinson's disease and the occurrence of complications. 
 alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) is a presynaptic protein that is widely implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder which afflicts an increasing number of individuals. 
 Grafting of dopamine-rich tissue to counteract the symptoms in Parkinson's disease became a promising tool for future treatment. 
While stem cells will most likely be the future source of cells to be used in grafting, it is important to find the guiding cues for how to reinnervate the dopamine-depleted striatum in a proper way with respect to the dopamine subpopulations of A9 and A10 to efficiently treat the motor abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Our results revealed that the endogenous levels of phospho-DARPPP-32 and phospho-ERK1/2 are elevated in "weaver" striatum probably as an adaptation phenomenon to gradual dopaminergic neurodegeneration appearing in this animal model, characterized as phenocopy of Parkinson's disease. 
This could be of clinical relevance since A(2A) antagonists are already used in clinical trials for ameliorating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. 
 BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Ergot-derived dopamine agonists (DAs) are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but may be associated with valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension. 
To assess generality of dopamine implication, we tested both dopamine enhancers in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dopamine blockers in Tourette's syndrome (TS). 
Accordingly, aberrant function of dopamine neurons underlies a wide spectrum of disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, and schizophrenia. 
 VPS41 is a protein identified as a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease (PD) as a result of a high-throughput RNAi screen in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
A low dose of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 5 microg/4 microl saline) was unilaterally infused into the medial forebrain bundle of nerve fibres in the rat brain in order to create a partial lesion of dopamine neurons which was sufficient to cause subtle behavioural deficits associated with early onset of Parkinson's disease without complete destruction of dopamine neurons. 
 BACKGROUND: The death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) appears to have various causes, including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction (and associated apoptosis), ubiquitin/proteasomal dysfunction, and inflammation, any of which could in principle be the therapeutic target of a neuroprotective drug. 
 Fatigue is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), occurring in up to 42% of patients (2). 
This is a study of modafinil for Parkinson's disease related fatigue.

METHODS: Green fluorescent protein-positive mesencephalic neuroepithelial stem cells were dissected from early rat embryos and transplanted into normal (n = 20) and Parkinson's disease (PD) rat model striata (n = 30). 
 In recent years there has been great interest in oscillatory activity in the brain and in the role of pathological oscillations in the basal ganglia in mediating some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Cell replacement therapy could be an important treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease (PD), which is caused by the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the midbrain (mDA). 
 BACKGROUND: It has been postulated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors alter disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but trials have produced conflicting results.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder marked by movement impairment caused by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. 
When both tonic and phasic levels of dopamine are decreased, as would be expected in unmedicated Parkinson's disease (PD), the model reproduces the deficits seen in a human PD group off medication. 
These findings support the view that the cognitive dysfunctions seen in Parkinson's disease are not solely either due to the decreased tonic level of dopamine or to the decreased responsiveness of the phasic dopamine signal to reward and punishment, but to a combination of the two factors that varies dependent on disease stage and medication status. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the STN is a target structure for the antidyskinetic action of sarizotan and indicate that drug-mediated modulation of STN activity may be an alternative option for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. 
It has been reported that the alpha-2-adrenergic pathways can modulate the levodopa- and apomorphine-induced dopaminergic turning behavior in the rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These movement disorders can be due to a poor or difficult capacity to carry out movements similar to the type observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (parkinsonism secondary to drugs) or also because of excess movement with acute or chronic dystonic or choreic clinical pictures. 
The disorder caused by scarcity of movement is a parkinsonian picture that it may be impossible to distinguish from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present neuropsychiatric and conduct disorders at different stages of the development of the disease that make treatment even more difficult. 
 Apomorphine is a dopamine receptor agonist for treating Parkinson's disease. 
 Neuronal correlates of Parkinson's disease (PD) include a shift to lower frequencies in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchronized oscillations at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. 
 BACKGROUND: Animal models of Parkinson's disease have been widely used for investigating the mechanisms of neurodegenerative process and for discovering alternative strategies for treating the disease. 
Following 10 injections with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 25 mg/kg) and probenecid (250 mg/kg) over 5 weeks in mice, we have established and characterized a chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease (MPD), which displays severe long-term neurological and pathological defects resembling that of the human Parkinson's disease in the advanced stage. 
The health benefit of exercise in aging and in neurodegenerative disorders including the Parkinson's disease has been implicated; however, clinical and laboratory studies in this area are limited. 
The present studies were designed to examine both the neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions of NNZ-2591 on neurochemical and behavioural changes in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
This receptor is of current interest in neurology because of its potential involvement in psychiatric and motor complications in Parkinson's disease and the possibility that dopamine D(3)-preferring agonist therapy might delay progression of the disorder. 
Preclinical data indicate that striatal levels of the D(3) (but not the D(2)) DA receptor are decreased following lesion of nigrostriatal DA neurons; at present, there are no in vivo data on this receptor subtype in Parkinson's disease. 
The objective of this positron emission tomography study was to compare [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO (D(3) versus D(2) preferring) and [(11)C]raclopride (D(3) = D(2)) binding in brain of non-depressed, non-demented, dopaminergic drug-naïve patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (n = 10), relative to matched-controls (n = 9). 
Parkinson's disease was associated with a trend for bilaterally decreased [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO (but not [(11)C]raclopride) binding in the D(3)-rich ventral striatum (-11%, P = 0.07) and significantly decreased binding in globus pallidus (-42%, P = 0.02). 
D(3) receptor levels might be a determinant vulnerability factor underlying side-effects associated with treatment; hence, these initial findings provide valuable baseline information to understand the role of D(3) receptors in response to Parkinson's disease medication. 
 Classical pathological signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) include loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra (SN) and noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus (LC), and deposition of Lewy bodies rich in the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (ASYN). 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder where dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of ventral mesencephalon undergo degeneration. 
Thus, when trying to rescue dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease, improving the noradrenergic input to the substantia nigra might be worth considering. 
 Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. 
Furthermore, the dopaminergic cell death induced by BH4 is apoptotic in nature and involves oxidative stress, similar to that observed in Parkinson's disease. 
 For more than 50 years, Parkinson's disease (PD) has been conceptualized as a product of nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system degeneration. 
 It has been over forty years since dopamine neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra and Lewy body formation within surviving cells were described as the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Thus, these results would also contribute to understanding the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related syndromes.

We have identified the cell self-destructive proNGF-p75NTR-sortilin signalling apparatus assembled in ventral tier dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, suggesting that p75NTR signalling might be involved in selective cell death mechanisms of substantia nigra neurons or disease progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is reviewed in light of recent advances in the understanding of the functional organization of the basal ganglia (BG).

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a progressive degeneration of the midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) that predominantly affects the ventral population projecting to the dorsal striatum and leads to a gradual dysfunction of the motor system. 
 The clinical motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is primarily the consequence of a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the nigrostriatal pathway.

 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease, the most common adult neurodegenerative movement disorder, demonstrates a brain-wide pathology that begins pre-clinically with alpha-synuclein aggregates ("Lewy neurites") in processes of gut enteric and vagal motor neurons. 
The vast majority of Parkinson's disease occurs sporadically, and current models of sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) can utilize directly infused or systemic neurotoxins. 
RESULTS: We developed a differentiation protocol for human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma that yielded non-dividing dopaminergic neural cells with long processes that we then exposed to 50 nM rotenone, a complex I inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease models. 
CONCLUSION: Subacute rotenone treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells causes process retraction and partial death over several weeks, slowed mitochondrial movement in processes and appears to reproduce the Lewy neuritic changes of early Parkinson's disease pathology but does not cause Lewy body inclusions. 
This rotenone-SH-SY5Y model in a differentiated human neural cell mimics changes of early Parkinson's disease and may be useful for screening therapeutics for neuroprotection in that disease stage.

Evidence suggests that the use of individual auditory cueing devices may be used effectively for the management of gait and freezing in people with Parkinson's disease. 
The primary aim of the randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of an individual auditory cueing device on freezing and gait speed in people with Parkinson's disease. 
A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of such a device on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease using a qualitative methodology.

 Akinetic crisis (AC) is a much-feared complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) which may appear upon abrupt cessation or malabsorption of dopaminergic medication due to gastrointestinal tract disorders or acute surgery. 
 Parkinson's disease is caused by a progressive loss of the midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
Although the main cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown, there is increasing evidence that it is a complex disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which affect key signalling pathways in substantia nigra DA neurons. 
Insights into pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease stem from in vitro and in vivo models and from postmortem analyses.

We characterized synaptic plasticity in the SNr using field potentials evoked with a nearby microelectrode (fEPs), in 18 Parkinson's disease patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). 
Dopamine medication state clearly impacts fEP amplitude, and the lasting nature of the increase is reminiscent of LTP-like changes, indicating that aberrant synaptic plasticity may play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.

Patients with Parkinson's disease that receive transplants of foetal ventral mesencephalic tissue, the graft cell preparation is likely to contain, in addition to dopamine neurons, serotonin neurons that will vary in number depending on the landmarks used for dissection. 
We conclude that it is not the absolute number of serotonin neurons in the grafts, but the relative densities of dopamine and serotonin innervations in the grafted striatum that is the critical factor in determining the long-term effect of foetal tissue graft, beneficial or detrimental, on dyskinesia in grafted Parkinson's disease patients. 
 PURPOSE: Depression is a common symptom in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) and markedly reduces their quality of life. 
 Using hybrid-blocked/event-related fMRI and the 2-back task we aimed to decompose tonic and phasic temporal dynamics of basal ganglia response abnormalities in working memory associated with early untreated Parkinson's disease. 
In view of the tonic/phasic dopamine hypothesis, which posits a functional division between phasic D(2)-dependent striatal updating processes and tonic D(1)-dependent prefrontal context-maintenance processes, we predicted that newly diagnosed, drug-naïve Parkinson's disease patients, with selective striatal dopamine deprivation, would demonstrate transient rather than sustained activation changes in the basal ganglia during 2-back performance. 
The obtained results yielded uniquely transient underactivation foci in caudate nuclei, putamen and globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease patients, which indicates suboptimal phasic implementation of striatal D(2)-dependent gating mechanisms during updating. 
The present findings resonate well with the tonic/phasic dopamine account and suggest that basal ganglia under-recruitment associated with executive dysfunction in early Parkinson's disease might predominantly stem from deficiencies in phasic executive components subserved by striatum. 
 Experiential therapies, such as enriched environment (EE), have been shown to influence the neurodegenerative processes that underlie Parkinson's disease. 
Here we compare the influence of exposure to EE prior to versus after dopamine depletion in the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These data indicate that enriched lifestyle before the onset of motor symptoms and rehabilitation programs after diagnosis might be beneficial in patients with Parkinson's disease.

 Methamphetamine (METH) produces nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) loss, partly resembling that which occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The chronic use of methamphetamine leads to cardiomyopathy and a nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency that partly mimics what occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
Despite the similarities concerning the nigrostriatal dopamine denervation, methamphetamine failed to produce chronic norepinephrine depletion in the heart, thus contrasting with what occurs in Parkinson's disease or after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. 
These data suggest that the chronic cardiovascular effects induced by methamphetamine rely on biochemical changes which differ from those activated by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine or during the course of Parkinson's disease.

Currently, studies suggest that the generation of free radicals by oxidative catabolism of DA and dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiration chain are important mediators of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) and one process may counter the effect of the other. 
Such findings have important implications with regard to sex differences in nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, in general, and, in specific, to sex differences related to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration like that in response to MA and in Parkinson's disease, where a greater incidence is typically reported for males. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative diseases caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
METHODS: The rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) was established by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into right substantia nigra of brain, then, the model of LID in rat was produced by injecting levodopa (LD) and benserazide for 4 weeks. 
 BACKGROUND: The dopamine deficiency syndrome Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and reduced postural reflexes. 
 BACKGROUND: Early Parkinson's disease is dominated by a motor syndrome called parkinsonism, but as the disease develops motor complications and non-motor problems may occur as well. 
This paper describes how to diagnose Parkinson's disease and the various motor complications and gives recommendations on how to treat the symptoms in these patients. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The paper builds on international evidence-based publications and the Norwegian guidelines for treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Motor symptoms such as tremor at rest, akinesia, rigidity and postural instability are the cardinal signs in Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) provides a model for assessing their role in humans. 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease with invariant loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons and striatal projections. 
However, it is now apparent that Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder with patients exhibiting symptoms derived from peripheral nervous system and extra-nigral dysfunctions in addition to the prototypical nigrostriatal damage. 
Although the etiology for sporadic Parkinson's disease is unknown, information gleaned from both familial forms of the disease and animal models places misfolded alpha-synuclein at the forefront. 
The addition of protofibrillar/oligomer-directed neurotherapeutics to the existing armamentarium may extend the symptom-free stage of Parkinson's disease as well as alleviate pathogenesis. 
Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of psychosis-related disease, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, or were initiated on psychosis-related medications. 
 We report on a 57-year-old woman, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, whose panic disorder showed marked improvement after introduction of bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. 
Bupropion may be useful for the treatment of patients with both panic disorder and Parkinson's disease. 
Rasagiline is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) as monotherapy (without levodopa) or as adjunct therapy (with levodopa) in patients with end of dose fluctuations. 
A total of 754 patients with Parkinson's disease were enrolled, 545 of the patients (63% male patients, mean age 68 years, mean duration of PD 6 years, Hoehn & Yahr stage II to III in 69% of the patients) started rasagiline 1 mg/day as adjunct therapy for up to 4 months. 
These findings suggest that Lmx1a may be critical to the development of mDA neurons from hES cells and that, along with other key early DA markers (i.e., Aldh1a1), may prove to be extremely useful for the selection of appropriately staged and suitably mDA-specified hES cells for cell replacement in Parkinson's disease. 
 Overactivity of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia is known to be closely related to the onset and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
In order to investigate the changes of glutamate transporters after the onset of Parkinson's disease, unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat, an animal model of Parkinson's disease, was employed. 
Collectively, these results support an important functional interaction between 5-HT1AR and D1R in the striatum with implications for the improved treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We determined plasma amantadine concentrations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in daily clinical practice and investigated the relationship between plasma concentration and adverse reactions to clarify the safe therapeutic range. 
It is therefore recommended to use amantadine at the plasma concentration of less than 3000 ng/ml in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, especially in elderly patients. 
Hormone levels were not correlated with sequential movement performance in either older or younger men, suggesting that sex hormones do not modulate sequential movement in men, and hormone replacement may not restore a loss of sequential movement ability in elderly men or men with Parkinson's disease. 
 (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT binding to striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) is markedly reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and it may also help in identifyng pre-symptomatic nigrostriatal dysfunction in subjects at risk. 
Our findings indicate that (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT with semiquantitative analysis can offer a more accurate characterization of the dopaminergic damage in patients with suspected Parkinson's disease. 
 In addition to classic motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by cognitive and emotional deficits, which have been demonstrated to precede motor impairments. 
 Failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade abnormal proteins may underlie the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration that occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
Consequently, a reduction of functional proteasome activity has been implicated in Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease, olfactory deficits were found in up to 90% of patients, and there is evidence for dopaminergic dysfunction underlying these deficits. 
 The contribution of (R)-enantiomer of N-methyl-salsolinol (1,2-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline; NMSal) to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been predominantly suggested by in vitro experiments in cell culture and by an in vivo study in which this compound has been directly injected into the rat striatum. 
 In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of a benzylideneacetophenone derivative, JC3, in a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
and Europe for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Clinical evidence has shown a correlation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), as abnormal glucose tolerance has been reported in >50% of PD patients. 
In Parkinson's disease, 15 to 60% patients speak, laugh, shout, kick, punch or fight invisible enemies during REM sleep. 
This condition may also expose patients with Parkinson's disease to a higher risk of daytime and nighttime hallucinations, and to more frequent cognitive impairment. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by dopaminergic (DA) neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients express motor symptoms only after 60-80% striatal dopamine (DA) depletion. 
 The induction of Parkinson's disease (PD) in senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8) by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and the effects of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) on induced PD model mice of SAMP8 were investigated for 5 wk. 
 LRRK2, alpha-synuclein, UCH-L1 and DJ-1 are implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. 
However, the recent demonstration of primary (e.g., non-dopamine related) neurodegenerative phenomena restricted to the CM-Pf in Parkinson's disease (PD) has renewed interest in the role played by the caudal intralaminar nuclei in the pathophysiology of PD. 
 There is accumulating evidence that the centre median-parafascicular (CM/Pf) complex of the thalamus is implicated in basal ganglia-related movement disorders and notably in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative diseases. 
The introduction of dopamine agonists early in the treatment of Parkinson's disease leads to a delay of these motor complications, but the treatment is associated with higher costs.In this review we evaluate available cost-effectiveness analyses of the dopamine agonists pramipexole, pergolide, bromocriptine, ropinirole, cabergoline and levodopa in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. 
Considerable methodological differences in the identified studies complicate a comparison and impede clear evidence as to which dopamine agonist treatment is the most cost effective in early Parkinson's disease. 
Novel head-to-head comparisons considering the actual treatment guidelines are necessary to identify the most cost-effective alternative in treating de novo Parkinson's disease patients. 
 High-frequency stimulation of around 130 Hz delivered to the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS [deep brain stimulation]) is an effective treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms of its therapeutic effect remain obscure.

 Chronic levodopa treatment for Parkinson's disease patients is frequently associated with the development of motor complications such as end-of-dose wearing-off and dyskinesias. 
We highlight the importance of initiating therapy with a treatment strategy that reduces the risk that a Parkinson's disease patient will develop motor complications in the first place. 
 Degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is the characteristic neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease and therapy is primarily based on a dopamine replacement strategy. 
 Dyskinesia affects approximately 30 to 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease but treatment options for the prevention of dyskinesia induction and for the suppression of established dyskinesia are limited. 
 Although levodopa remains the most effective drug for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease, chronic therapy with this pharmacological compound initiates a complex cascade of cellular and molecular downstream effects resulting in the development of abnormal involuntary movements. 
We concentrate on the "motor circuit" because it is the best understood anatomically and physiologically, and because Parkinson's disease is mainly thought to be a movement disorder. 
Dopaminergic depletion in Parkinson's disease disrupts the corticostriatal balance leading to increased activity the indirect circuit and reduced activity in the direct circuit. 
 The objective of this study was to determine if the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, sildenafil, could be used as a neuroprotective agent in a chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) murine model of Parkinson's disease.

 Long-term treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) with the dopamine-precursor levodopa (l-DOPA) results in the development of motor fluctuations, including involuntary movements, termed l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). 
 Appearance of dyskinesia is a common problem of long-term Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and represents a major limitation for the pharmacological management of the motor symptoms in the advanced stages of disease. 
The new avenues that the increasing knowledge of 5-HT in motor control has opened for exploring the pathophysiology and pharmacology of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders will be discussed. 
Recent evidence suggests that dysfunction of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems contributes to various disorders including depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. 
Taken together, neurochemical approaches using microdialysis can not only contribute to clarification of the physiological role of the serotonergic neuronal systems but may also be a powerful pharmacological approach for the development of therapeutic strategies to the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. 
Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the dysfunction of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmission might underlie the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, drug abuse, Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and Parkinson's disease. 
Quinone formation is closely linked to other representative hypotheses such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. 
These data may have therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease, when SNr HA levels increase, and for neuropsychiatric disorders in which 5-HT is pivotal. 
 Mouse models of MPTP intoxication have been used extensively to explore the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. 
Even under these conditions, dopaminergic cell loss was moderate (-25%) and other neurodegenerative changes characteristic of Parkinson's disease remained undetectable. 
Hence, giving uridine and DHA may partially restore dopaminergic neurotransmission in this model of Parkinson's disease.

 Several studies have confirmed that subthalamic and pallidal local field potential activity in the beta frequency band (13-30 Hz) is exaggerated in untreated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and is suppressed by dopaminergic treatment. 
Our findings suggest that beta activity is enhanced in the chronically dopamine-depleted and blocked state irrespective of the underlying pathology, consistent with the idea that excessive synchrony in the beta band is directly related to dopaminergic hypofunction, rather than some degenerative disease-specific attribute of Parkinson's disease. 
 The overlap among tremor disorders is wide and complex because essential tremor patients may present resting tremor coexisting with postural tremor, while postural may coexist with resting tremor in Parkinson's disease.

These findings may lead to be development of estrogen therapy for the prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
A single dose of modafinil improved the ability of emergency room physicians to attend didactic lectures after a night shift, but did not improve their ability to drive home and caused sleep disturbances subsequently.Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo.Trials of modafinil for excessive sleepiness in Parkinson's disease, cocaine addiction and cognition in chronic fatigue syndrome provided inconsistent results; all studies had extremely small sample sizes.

 The mechanism by which the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta degenerate in Parkinson's disease, is partly unknown. 
 A variety of behavioral disorders occurring abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been recently published and attracted considerable attention in the press. 
 Neuroinflammatory processes have been implicated in the progressive loss of ventral midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons that give rise to Parkinson's disease (PD), a late-onset movement disorder that affects 2% of the population over the age of 70 years. 
 OBJECTIVE: Recent trials suggest that using ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as cabergoline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is associated with an increased risk of valvular heart disease. 
However, the dose of cabergoline used to treat hyperprolactinaemia is considerably less than that used in Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopamine neurons containing neuromelanin selectively degenerate. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. 
 Lewy bodies are mainly composed of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and specific mutations in SNCA gene are related to familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The present research investigates factors contributing to bradykinesia in the control of simple and complex voluntary limb movement in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized clinically by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability due to progressive and selective loss of dopamine neurons in the ventral substantia nigra, with the presence of ubiquitinated protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the neurons. 
 Evidence suggests inflammation, mitochondria dysfunction, and oxidative stress play major roles in Parkinson's disease (PD), where the primary pathology is the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). 
Loss of dopamine input to the striatum, as in models of Parkinson's disease (PD), also results in a sensitization of responses to dopamine agonists that is manifest by increased activation of ERK1/2 in the dorsal striatum. 
Altered brain DA signaling is suspected to underlie multiple brain disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
 Several lines of evidence support the neuroprotective action of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in various models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, few studies have investigated the impact that early life stress might have on the onset and development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, which is characterized in part by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. 
Our results therefore suggest that adverse experiences sustained during early life contribute to making dopamine neurons more susceptible to subsequent insults occurring during more mature stages of life and may therefore play a role in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sleep problems are frequent and disabling in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders expose patients to higher risks of dementia and hallucinations. 
The neuropathology of hypothalamus in Parkinson's disease indicates a massive hypocretin loss, probably underlying the narcolepsy phenotype.

 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. 
 Aging is the strongest risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Ergot-derived dopamine receptor agonists, especially pergolide and cabergoline, have been associated with an increased risk of valvular heart disease in patients treated for Parkinson's disease. 
Cabergoline at lower doses than those employed in Parkinson's disease is widely used in patients with prolactinomas, because of its high efficacy and tolerability; however, its safety with regard to cardiac valve disease is unknown. 
Manipulating striatal adenosine transmission via blockade of the A2A receptor subtype can compensate for the reduced dopamine activity within the striatum that underlies movement disorders such as antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These novel findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of MPD, regulation of DA sequestration/release, and treatment of disorders affecting DA disposition, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse, and Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, to provide basic data for neuroprotective therapy in Parkinson's disease, we investigated neuroprotection against glutamate toxicity by dopamine agonists. 
We have retrospectively investigated its role over a duration of upto six years in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to study: (1) its influence on the progression of disability related to PD; (2) effect on blood pressure and weight during the treatment period; (3) whether the use of pergolide has a long term levodopa sparing effect; (4) and how is it tolerated during this period? We studied 43 patients who had been on adjunct therapy with pergolide in addition to levodopa for more than six months. 
We conclude that pergolide is a valuable adjunct therapy with levodopa over a duration of upto six years to maintain control of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

 Thyroid disease is the endocrine dysfunction most frequently reported in association with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Further, treatment with l-dopa and/or dopaminergic drugs and the stage of Parkinson's disease did not affect thyroid function. 
Indeed, neurologists should be alerted to the possible complications arising from thyroid dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, but thyroid function tests should be performed only when justified on clinical grounds. 
Nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, the target cells for degeneration in Parkinson's disease, display receptors for basic fibroblast growth factor and these receptors are decreased in the brain of parkinsonian patients. 
 The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degeneration of the dopamine (DA) producing cells in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmentum, resulting in a dopamine deficiency in the dopaminergic projection areas with defective functioning of specific cortico-subcortical extrapyramidal circuits. 
Further studies are warranted to determine the role of adenosine in experimental and clinical Parkinson's disease.

 An important issue raised in testing new neuroprotective/restorative treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) is the optimal stage in the disease process to initiate therapy. 
 Parkinson's disease is a common progressive neurodegenerative condition with multiple motor and nonmotor features contributing to impairment of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). 
These treatments to restore motor function are often very successful in early Parkinson's disease, with objective improvement and concomitant improvement in subjective HR-QOL scores. 
Drugs that have been more recently added to the armamentarium of Parkinson's disease, including the oral (pramipexole, ropinirole and piribedil) and transdermal (rotigotine) non-ergotamine-derived dopamine agonists, the novel MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline and the COMT inhibitors tolcapone and entacapone, were included. 
Rasagiline improved HR-QOL as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease (one study), but not clearly in more advanced disease (one study). 
Rotigotine improved HR-QOL in both early Parkinson's disease (one study) and more advanced disease with motor fluctuations (one study). 
The impact of ropinirole and pramipexole on HR-QOL as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease versus placebo has not been assessed, but both agents have resulted in improved HR-QOL in patients with motor fluctuations (ropinirole one study, pramipexole one study).

 INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Dopamine agonists have been reported to increase the risk of cardiac valve regurgitation in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Mean cumulative dose of cabergoline was lower in patients with HyperPRL than that reported to be deleterious for patients with Parkinson's disease: hence, longer follow-up is necessary, particularly in patients receiving weekly doses > 3 mg. 
This study was designed to elucidate its neuroprotective effects against 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity (known as in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease, respectively).

Dopamine agonists are used in early Parkinson's disease treatment. 
Taken together, in vivo investigations on animal models of Parkinson's disease showed decreases of dopamine storage, dopamine release and dopamine transporter binding, no alterations of dopamine synthesis and DA release, and either increases or no alterations of D2 receptor binding, while in vivo investigations of animal models of Huntington's disease.

 Dopamine agonists are highly effective as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
These drugs have rapidly gained popularity as a monotherapy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease for patients < 65-70 years old, because they are about as effective as levodopa, but patients demonstrate a lower tendency to develop motor complications.

 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We used (123)I-Ioflupane SPECT to study 32 unrelated patients with essential tremor (16 with positive familial history), 47 sporadic tremor dominant patients with Parkinson's disease and 31 healthy control subjects. 
Discriminant analysis was used to categorize healthy subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor. 
RESULTS: Patients with essential tremor had higher uptake values (50% putamen and 21% caudate, P<0.001) compared to those with Parkinson's disease but lower than healthy subjects (15% putamen and 21% caudate, P<0.05). 
Discriminant analysis classified seven essential tremor patients in the healthy subjects cohort (22%) and two as Parkinson's disease (6%). 
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that some essential tremor patients may present mild abnormalities of striatal dopamine transporters and a typical Parkinson's disease-like pattern of uptake loss. 
Although sexual dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease, the development of hypersexuality and aberrant sexual behaviour, probably due to dopamine replacement therapy, calls into question the role of dopamine in sexual behaviour. 
Blood DNA from 80 control individuals and 118 age-matched Parkinson's disease patients were analyzed for NQO2 gene promoter polymorphisms. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the D allele, but there was no difference in the frequency of the alleles in familial compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. 
The results suggest that the association of the D promoter with Parkinson's disease may be due to an increase in expression of the NQO2 gene.

 After 20 years follow-up of newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 100 of 136 (74%) have died. 
Degeneration of dopaminergic projections in Parkinson's disease and animals reduces, whereas ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) promotes, neurogenesis. 
Because CNTF is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, this mechanism and the ability to pharmacologically modulate it have implications for Parkinson's disease and cell-replacement therapies for other disorders. 
 Rotigotine is a new, non-ergoline dopamine receptor agonist developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in a transdermal formulation (Neupro ) to provide sustained drug delivery for 24 h with a once daily dosing. 
It is concluded that a continuous dopaminergic stimulation of dopamine receptors by rotigotine may not only be beneficial for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease but also have additional benefits by not compromising either sleep architecture or circadian rhythm. 
 BACKGROUND: The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive despite identification of several genetic mutations. 
Here we report that inflammation can trigger degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in an animal model of Parkinson's disease.

 The pedunculopontine nucleus has recently been introduced as a new therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, particularly those with severe gait and postural impairment. 
Therefore, we looked for and demonstrated evidence of low frequency synchronization of activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus of a patient with Parkinson's disease that increased after treatment with dopamine and which might be mimicked by local deep brain stimulation at low frequency. 
 PURPOSE: A literature evaluation of antidopaminergic therapies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have developed psychosis, nausea, vomiting, and hiccups was conducted.

 L-3,4-dihydroxypheylalanine (L-dopa)-induced dyskinesia represent a debilitating complication of therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) that result from a progressive sensitization through repeated L-dopa exposures. 
This may be due to the distinct degree of lesions promoted in these different rat models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder which involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
 A transdermal patch formulation of the non-ergolinic dopamine receptor agonist rotigotine (Neupro) is indicated for use as monotherapy in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease or, in the EU, as an adjunct to levodopa across all disease stages. 
Transdermal rotigotine is an effective and generally well tolerated addition to the armamentarium for the control of Parkinson's disease, with the once-daily transdermal patch system offering several practical advantages and the possible benefits of avoiding pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation. 
Transdermal rotigotine was superior to placebo in patients with early-stage and advanced Parkinson's disease, although noninferiority to the oral dopamine receptor agonists ropinirole or pramipexole was not consistently demonstrated. 
In the meantime, transdermal rotigotine offers a convenient new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease.

The possible increase in NT levels in the basal ganglia under pathological conditions leading to the NTS1 enhancement of glutamate signalling may contribute to the neurodegeneration of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons found in Parkinson's disease, especially in view of the high density of NTS1 receptors in these neurons. 
The use of selective NTS1 antagonists together with conventional drug treatments could provide a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 In patients with Parkinson's disease, the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA medication is gradually lost over time, and abnormal involuntary movements, dyskinesias, gradually emerge as a prominent side-effect in response to previously beneficial doses of the drug. 
Removal of the serotonin afferents, or dampening of serotonin neuron activity by 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B agonist drugs, resulted in a near-complete block of the L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, suggesting that dysregulated dopamine release from serotonin terminals is the prime trigger of dyskinesia in the rat Parkinson's disease model.

 Although levodopa is the current "gold standard" for treatment of Parkinson's disease, there has been disputation on whether AMPA receptor antagonists can be used as adjuvant therapy to improve the effects of levodopa. 
Systemic administration of levodopa, the precursor of dopamine, increases brain dopamine turnover rate and this elevated turnover is believed to be essential for successful treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, drugs that feature potentiation of dopamine turnover rate and are able to reduce daily levodopa dosages might be used as adjuvant in the treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
We concluded from the present data that potentiation observed between levodopa and AMPA receptor antagonists may reflect levodopa-sparing effects in clinical treatment indicating the therapeutic potential of such combination in the management of Parkinson's disease.

These results suggest that drugs with a pharmacological profile similar to that of K/X may be useful to delay the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
A potential candidate is noradrenaline, since a severe loss of this neurotransmitter characterizes Parkinson's disease, and noradrenergic drugs produce a symptomatic relief of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. 
This study confirms a significant impact of the noradrenergic system in the natural history of Parkinson's disease and extends its role to the behavioural and morphological effects taking place during pulsatile dopamine replacement therapy. 
 The loss of dopamine neurons combined or not with the subsequent administration of L-DOPA in patients with Parkinson's disease or in experimental models of the disease results in altered GABAergic signaling throughout the basal ganglia, including the striatum and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata. 
The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that expression of the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) is altered in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease. 
As a whole, the results provide original evidence that vGAT expression is altered in the 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease.

 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of rotigotine, a nonergoline D(3)/D(2)/D(1) dopamine receptor agonist in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (RLS). 
DATA SYNTHESIS: Rotigotine has been investigated in early Parkinson's disease, as adjuvant therapy to levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease, and in RLS. 
In clinical trials of patients with early Parkinson's disease, rotigotine has decreased combined scores on the motor and activities of daily living sections of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale up to 85 weeks. 
In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, rotigotine reduced mean off-time when used as an adjuvant to levodopa. 
CONCLUSIONS: Longer trials are required to determine whether transdermal rotigotine will reduce development of dyskinesias and motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease and augmentation and rebound in RLS by preventing pulsatile dopamine stimulation associated with levodopa and other dopamine agonists.

METHODS: We performed an echocardiographic prevalence study in 155 patients taking dopamine agonists for Parkinson's disease (pergolide, 64 patients; cabergoline, 49; and non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists, 42) and 90 control subjects. 
 BACKGROUND: Case reports and echocardiographic studies suggest that the ergot-derived dopamine agonists pergolide and cabergoline, used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the restless legs syndrome, may increase the risk of cardiac-valve regurgitation. 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting mainly the elderly.

The discovery by Hornykiewicz and co-workers that levodopa could successfully treat Parkinson's disease in humans was one of the most important events of medicine in the 20th century. 
Since loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function is the basic underlying pathophysiology of this disease, drugs that enhance dopaminergic function in the striatum, including the exogenous precursor levodopa, remain the most effective symptomatic agents in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Safinamide is being developed in phase III for treatment of Parkinson's disease, whereas the development in epilepsy relates to the industrial strategy of the company. 
Movement disorders associated with basal ganglia dysfunction comprise a spectrum of abnormalities that range from the hypokinetic disorder (from which Parkinson's disease, PD, is the best-known-example) at one extreme to the hyperkinetic disorder (exemplified by Huntington's disease and hemiballism) at the other. 
 Dopamine active transporter (DAT) single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) is considered a useful and practical technique for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and assessment of its progression. 
 An intensive study is underway to evaluate different potential candidates for cell therapy of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The dopaminergic system of the basal ganglia has been implicated in the integration of sensory information important for balance based on studies in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
ST1535 may be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and effective in reducing the use of l-dopa. 
 We have recently demonstrated that two plant-derived cannabinoids, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol (CBD), are neuroprotective in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD), presumably because of their antioxidant properties. 
The dopamine system has been most intensively studied owing to its involvement in several brain disorders, including motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, as well as psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and compulsive behavioral disorders of multiple types. 
In this review, I focus on recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular biology of the CA system in humans in health and disease, especially in neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), in relation to the biosynthesis of CAs regulated by a pteridine-dependent monooxygenase, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH) and its pteridine cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). 
 INTRODUCTION: Around 1% of adults have Parkinson's disease, with a median time of 9 years between diagnosis and death. 
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease? What are the effects of adding other treatments in people with Parkinson's disease who have motor complications from levodopa? What are the effects of surgery in people with later Parkinson's disease? What are the effects of nursing and rehabilitation treatments in people with Parkinson's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). 
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding a catechol-methyl transferase inhibitor, or dopamine agonist to levodopa; amantadine; dopamine agonists; levodopa (immediate-release, modified-release); monoamine oxidase B inhibitors; occupational therapy; pallidal deep brain stimulation; pallidotomy; Parkinson's disease nurse specialist interventions; physiotherapy; speech and language therapy; subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation; subthalamotomy; swallowing therapy; thalamic deep brain stimulation; and thalamotomy.

 Challenge with low-dose apomorphine causes a rise in growth hormone (GH) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Controlled and open studies in depressed patients with Parkinson's disease show therapeutic effects of dopamine agonists on motor deficits, anhedonia, and depression. 
 Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that can cause significant disability and decreased quality of life. 
Levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, its long-term use is limited by motor complications and drug-induced dyskinesia. 
After levodopa-related motor complications develop in advanced Parkinson's disease, it is beneficial to initiate adjuvant therapy with dopamine agonists, catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors, or monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors. 
Depression, dementia, and psychosis are common psychiatric problems associated with Parkinson's disease. 
 We have previously demonstrated that dopamine conjugation to glucose allows it to induce therapeutic effects against Parkinson's disease after intravenous administration. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD), while primarily associated with degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, is now increasingly recognized to have more widespread cell loss and so the most effective cell replacement therapy should target all these neuronal losses. 
 Parkinson's disease is a severe, age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which a loss of substantia nigra-derived dopaminergic pathways to the striatum triggers profound motor perturbation, as well as cognitive, sensory and mood deficits. 
Of particular interest, dopamine D3 receptors contribute to the beneficial influence of dopaminergic agonists for the protection and restoration of dopaminergic pathways in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy bodies, whose major component is alpha-synuclein. 
The synaptic mechanisms of these actions are unknown but reduced levels of dopamine, for example in Parkinson's disease, leads to a paucity of behavioural output, whereas its excess production has been associated with psychiatric problems. 
 Using a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD), this study investigated on the neuroprotective effects of acupuncture by examining whether acupuncture contributed to inhibiting microglial activation and inflammatory events. 
Cells were cultured in dishes with integrated electrodes to deliver stimulation at the same parameters as those used in clinical conditions to treat advanced forms of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a heterogeneous clinical picture and a variable rate of progression. 
 Studies in yeast are providing critical insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results demonstrate that subtype-selective PPARdelta agonists possess antiapoptotic properties in vitro, which may underlie their potential neuroprotective potential in in vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra are highly vulnerable to the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease. 
Data indicate that microglial activation and consequent induction of NADPH oxidase may act as risk factors for Parkinson's disease by increasing the vulnerability of dopaminergic cells to toxic injury. 
 Disturbed comprehension of complex noncanonical sentences in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been linked to dopamine depletion and delayed lexical retrieval. 
 Numerous factors contribute to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neuron death in Parkinson's disease (PD), thus complicating the search for effective neuroprotective agents for this disease. 
 Alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) has been studied in the context of Parkinson's disease, but its normative role remains elusive. 
Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, followed in incidence by Parkinson's disease; much less common are frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, amyothrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), progressive supranuclear palsy, spinocerebellar ataxia, Pick's disease and, lastly, prion disease. 
The symptomatic therapy of motor behaviour in Parkinson's disease, based on l-DOPA, is registering adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and ion channel modulators, as well as dopamine uptake inhibitors and glutamate AMPA receptor antagonists. 
There are also many other drugs involved, including astrocyte-modulating agents, 5-HT(1A) agonists and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, which are targeted at preventing or ameliorating Parkinson's disease-related or l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. 
 The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three daily dosages of the triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor NS 2330 (tesofensine) compared to placebo as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Postmortem demonstration of increased iron in the substantia nigra (SN) is a well-appreciated finding in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Recent technologic advances make it increasingly possible to image neurotransmitter systems in living human brain, The dopamine system has been most intensively studied owing to its involvement in several brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, as well as psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and compulsive behavioral disorders of multiple types. 
 Parameters of saccadic eye movements were studied in patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. 
Moreover, the percentage of multistep saccades in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In support of this reasoning, the mean of saccade latency and the percentage of the multistep saccades decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease after dopamine D2/D3 agonist (piribedil) treatment, due to activity restoration of the indirect pathway. 
 OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is widely accepted in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders. 
This neuronal population increases in size in animal models of Parkinson's disease, where striatal DA levels are low, but its fate in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea is poorly known. 
In this study, we used antibodies raised against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a faithful marker of dopaminergic neurons, to compare, by means of stereological counting methods, the number of striatal TH+ neurons on post-mortem brain sections from Parkinson's disease patients, Huntington's disease patients and age-matched controls. 
The striatum of Parkinson's disease patients was found to contain six times less TH+ neurons than that of controls, whereas the striatum of Huntington's disease patients was largely devoid of such neurons. 
These findings are at odds with the results obtained in rodent and monkey models of Parkinson's disease, in which the number of striatal TH+ neurons is reported to increase markedly following DA denervation. 
Since Parkinson's disease patients examined in this study were all treated with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to compensate for the loss of striatal DA and that levels of striatal DA are reportedly higher in the striatum of Huntington's disease patients compared with controls, we hypothesize that local DA concentrations exert a negative feedback on the expression of TH phenotype by striatal interneurons. 
A better knowledge of factors governing the in vivo state of this ectopic neuronal population could open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. 
 We investigated the neuroprotective property of analogs of dextromethorphan (DM) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) models to identify neuroprotective drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Different regulation of nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways by nAChRs could be an important basis for developing novel drugs for treatment of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 GDNF is a potent neurotrophic factor for nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), but has largely failed when tested in therapeutic applications in human PD. 
The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine, including Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia. 
They cross the blood-brain barrier and exert their effect on dopaminergic system, contributing to the burden of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease through several pathways. 
These functions are lost in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
We explored here whether transplantation of human NSCs cloned by v-myc gene transfer, HB1.F3 cells, is a feasible therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease. 
Given that diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia are thought to involve adaptation of dopamine signalling, these findings might provide new insight into these pathologies and offer new avenues for drug development. 
 The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in subjects over 70 years old is simpler than in younger subjects for correcting the consequences of dopamine deficiency, but more complex with regard to symptoms resulting from non-dopaminergic lesions (axial symptoms, cognitive decline). 
The impact of direct cortical lesions can also be discussed but it seems that these lesions mostly contribute to the cognitive deficits in the late stages of Parkinson's disease. 
This hormone improves behavioral deficits and normalizes the nigral dopamine levels in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
To date, it is approved for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease as monotherapy and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of advanced-stage Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome in several clinical trials. 
Further, the rationale for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome with rotigotine is discussed. 
The side-effects are limited, particularly at the dosages usually prescribed for RLS treatment: They are much lower than in Parkinson's disease, and inappropriate sleepiness and sleep attacks, particularly while driving, or compulsive behavior have not been seen. 
In previous positron-emission-tomography (PET) studies, net blood-brain clearance of [18F]-fluoro-l-DOPA (FDOPA) correlated with impaired cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease or schizophrenia. 
 INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. 
AIM: To analyze the dispensation of antiparkinsonian agents in Spain and to estimate the Parkinson's disease prevalence. 
The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is considered in 1.7 per 1,000 inhabitants in Spain. 
 The critical observation in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is that neurodegeneration is largely restricted to dopaminergic neurons that develop cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies. 
These results show that RNAi-mediated alpha-synuclein knockdown alters cellular dopamine homeostasis in human cells and may suggest a mechanism for the increased survival in the presence of MPP(+), a toxin used extensively to model Parkinson's disease. 
 "A propensity to bend the trunk forward" and "the chin is now almost immovably bent down upon the sternum" were described by James Parkinson in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. 
 Recent studies have invoked inflammation as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Many current theories of Parkinson's disease (PD) suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the neurodegenerative process. 
We investigated changes in the expression of arrestins and GRKs in the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease without (PD) or with dementia (PDD) at postmortem using Western blotting and ribonuclease protection assay. 
 Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease exhibit impairments in executive processes, including planning and set-shifting, even at the early stages of the disease. 
Here the same fMRI protocol was used to compare the patterns of activation in a group of early-stage Parkinson's disease patients (seven right-handed patients at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 and 2; mean age 62 years, range 56-70) and matched control subjects. 
This event-related fMRI study showed a pattern of cortical activation in Parkinson's disease characterized by either reduced or increased activation depending on whether the caudate nucleus was involved or not in the task. 
These observations provide further evidence in favour of the hypothesis that not only the nigrostriatal and but also the mesocortical dopaminergic substrate may play a significant role in the cognitive deficits observed in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that is mainly caused by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. 
In this review, we provide a critical discussion on the utility of DAT imaging for Parkinson's disease diagnosis (sensitivity and specificity). 
 Levodopa has been the mainstay treatment for Parkinson's disease for several decades, but the precise mechanism for its therapeutic action is still not well understood. 
We have evaluated this approach in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra, neurons affected in Parkinson's disease, by adeno-associated virus 1 transduction with a gene encoding a myristoylated, constitutively active form of the oncoprotein Akt/PKB. 
 Selective loss of dopaminergic neurons is the final common pathway in Parkinson's disease. 
These data suggest a model in which ER- and dopamine-related stress are major contributors to decreased viability of dopaminergic neurons in a setting relevant to Parkinson's disease. 
 The aim of this study was to investigate further the hormone-dependent processes underlying sex differences in neurotoxic responses within the rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic (NSDA) pathway after partial lesioning with 6-OHDA, a state thought to mimic the early stages of Parkinson's disease where, in humans and animal models alike, males appear to be more susceptible. 
 The aims of this study were to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sumanirole, a highly selective D(2) dopamine receptor agonist, versus placebo in subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), and to demonstrate noninferiority of sumanirole to ropinirole. 
Both dopamine agonists, sumanirole and ropinirole, were statistically superior compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, based on UPDRS II + III total score. 
 The impairment of the mesostriatal dopaminergic system has been considered responsible for motor and affective disturbances associated with aging and a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. 
These findings suggest that both the nigrostriatal and the mesolimbic systems are vulnerable to aging, but in contrast to what occurs in Parkinson's disease, the mesolimbic system is more vulnerable to aging than the nigrostriatal one. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive motor disorder, but frequently is accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as hypotension. 
 Although the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, a common element of most theories is the involvement of oxidative stress, either as a cause or effect of the disease. 
 The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease in the rat represents a fundamental tool for investigating the pathophysiology of dopamine denervation. 
 Continuous dopamine (DA) stimulation is a therapeutic approach that applies to the treatment of motor fluctuations due to pulsatile DA stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD), to cure the abuse of drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamine (which produce short-lasting peaks of extracellular DA), and as a safe therapeutic approach to avoid hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation (which sometime develops as an abuse pattern in PD patients receiving a pulsatile DA replacement therapy). 
 Recent studies disclosed the relevance of specific molecules for the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD) and for the composition of neuronal inclusions. 
In addition, we approach a highly controversial question: can the adult human brain use neurogenesis to replace the dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra that are lost in Parkinson's disease?  Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been identified as the cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) at the PARK8 locus. 
 Dopamine cytotoxicity is thought to contribute towards the selective loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neurons and disease progression in Parkinson's disease. 
Selegiline has been shown to be efficacious in Parkinson's disease, global ischemia, Gille de la Tourette syndrome, and narcolepsy. 
 BACKGROUND: Therapeutic management of gait disorders in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) can sometimes be disappointing, since dopaminergic drug treatments and subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation are more effective for limb-related parkinsonian signs than for gait disorders. 
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate gender differences in basic disease characteristics, motor deterioration and nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 PURPOSE: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]FP-CIT is a marker for loss of presynaptic dopamine transporters in the striatum in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
We evaluated the effects of four DAs (pergolide, cabergoline, ropinirole, pramipexole) on morphology and function of heart valves in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of DA-induced VHD. 
This has novel implications for the use of the weaver mouse as a model for Parkinson's disease, which has been associated with increased neuroinflammation. 
Furthermore, increased delta opioid receptor transmission may be causative in the production of dyskinesia following repeated dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
However, in the more chronic MPTP-lesioned macaque model, simple changes in delta opioid receptor number or affinity are unlikely to contribute to mechanisms for abnormal opioid transmission in Parkinson's disease and dyskinesia. 
 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Functional pre-synaptic dopamine brain imaging is generally abnormal when parkinsonism is degenerative (such as in idiopathic Parkinson's disease) and normal in patients with non-degenerative movement disorder (such as essential tremor). 
However, some patients diagnosed as early Parkinson's disease have normal presynaptic dopamine imaging. 
Follow-up of patients with normal imaging should help determine whether such patients truly have degenerative parkinsonism (and therefore represent false negative imaging results), or emerge as cases of non-degenerative parkinsonism (and therefore represent initial clinical over-diagnosis of Parkinson's disease). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a selective loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), which in turn results in dopamine depletion in the striatum, and the presence of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs). 
 The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are associated with abnormal, correlated, low frequency, rhythmic burst activity in the subthalamic nucleus and connected nuclei. 
Research into the mechanisms controlling the pattern of subthalamic activity has intensified because therapies that manipulate the pattern of subthalamic activity, such as deep brain stimulation and levodopa administration, improve motor function in Parkinson's disease. 
 Extradural motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) is a surgical procedure proposed for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who cannot undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS). 
 It has been suggested that L-DOPA-induced hyperhomocysteinemia can increase the risk of stroke, heart disease, and dementia and is an additional pathogenetic factor involved in the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
The present results could have implications for Parkinson's disease. 
Also, the feasibility of individual rat brain statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was explored for (18)F-FDG and DAT imaging of a 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease.METHODS: Ten adult Wistar rats were scanned repetitively with multitracer small-animal PET. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which have long axons enriched with microtubules. 
 Pharmacotherapy designed to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease is focused on the stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors. 
However, Nurr1-induced DA neurons exhibit immature neuronal morphologies and functional properties and are unable to induce behavioral recovery in rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The involvement of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the pathophysiology and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse, neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)) and depression has long been recognized. 
In addition, the involvement of 5-HT2C receptors in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and other related motor disorders, and their management with drugs blocking the 5-HT2C receptor will be discussed. 
PARTICIPANTS: Four patients diagnosed with a major mood disorder and comorbid Parkinson's disease were treated successfully with adjunctive ziprasidone at doses of 80 to 160mg/d. 
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ziprasidone may be an efficacious and well tolerated therapy in patients with comorbid Parkinson's disease and psychiatric illness. 
 The correct identity and functional capacity of transplanted dopamine (DA) neurons derived in vitro from embryonic stem (ES) cells is a critical factor for the development of an ES cell-based replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease.

The results suggest that cFLZ possesses potent neuroprotective activity and may be a potential anti-Parkinson's disease drug worthy for further study. 
The gradual induction of dopamine D(1) receptor supersensitivity is known as a priming phenomenon, and this process is thought to underlie not only the appearance of vacuous chewing movements in humans with tardive dyskinesia, but also the onset of motor dyskinesias in L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-treated Parkinson's disease patients. 
 alpha-Synuclein is a synaptic protein that has been directly linked to both the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Ropinirole is a nonergoline dopamine D(2)-receptor agonist and has been proven to be effective in both monotherapy and combination therapy for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Alpha synuclein mediated regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase has also been incorporated in the model, allowing an insight into the overexpression and aggregation of alpha synuclein in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is classically characterised as a motor neurodegenerative disorder. 
There is now an increasing interest in the cognitive and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and in cholinesterase-inhibitor therapy for dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. 
We also discuss a convergent versus parallel model to explain cognitive dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease according to dopamine-acetylcholine dependent alterations in synaptic plasticity. 
 The underlying cause of Parkinson's disease is still enigma.

 We describe two patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who developed clinical criteria of pathological gambling addiction in the setting of increased dopamine replacement therapy (levodopa and dopamine agonist medications). 
 We determined whether tetrahydrobiopterin(BH4), an endogenous cofactor for dopamine(DA) synthesis, causes preferential damage to DArgic neurons among primary cultured rat mesencephalic neurons and whether the death mechanism has relevance to Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive slowness in activities of daily living and is the most common cause of parkinsonism, whose symptoms include resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and bradykinesia. 
The introduction of levodopa and its positive effect on motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease has allowed neurologists to focus on motor fluctuations. 
Thus, dopamine-related disorders like Parkinson's disease may not stem from changes in the overall levels of cortical activity, but from dysfunctional activity coordination in corticostriatal circuits. 
Using a progressive 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned (MPTP) macaque model that mimics the progression of Parkinson's disease in vivo ([99mTc]-TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) and ex vivo ([125I]-nortropane DAT labelling) endpoints were evaluated. 
 Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is the second cause of akinetic rigid syndrome in the Western world and its prevalence is increasing and approaching that of idiopathic Parkinson's disease due to the ageing of the population and to the rising of polypharmacotherapy. 
Special precautions are needed in elderly subjects, in patients treated with multiple drugs for prolonged periods of time and in those with familial risk factors including familial parkinsonism or tremor, or in those with genetic variants of genes involved in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Several recent studies have reported the relationship between PG and the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), but no prevalence study has yet been conducted to investigate this correlation. 
Furthermore, combined with reports of a complex I defect in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the present study affirms the utility of MPTP in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD. 
 Dopamine depletion is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, whereas hyperdopaminergia may play a fundamental role in generating endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia. 
Sleep disturbances are known to occur in both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that dopamine plays a role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. 
 The production of dopamine (DA) neurons from neural progenitor cells (NPC) is of particular interest as these neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease. 
 Many of the motoric features that define Parkinson's disease (PD) result primarily from the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.

We propose that DDD mice represent a novel acute model of severe DA deficiency that might be used to identify compounds with potential therapeutic use for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The adenosine A2A receptor has emerged as an attractive non-dopaminergic target in the pursuit of improved therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), based in part on its unique CNS distribution. 
These cells are also used to test mechanisms and potential therapeutics relevant to the loss of DA neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
The future use of one or a combination of growth or other factors to differentiate MN9D cells may yield a more useful model system for Parkinson's disease studies in vitro. 
 L-DOPA is the most effective pharmacological agent used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease but long-term L-DOPA treatment induces involuntary abnormal movements such as dyskinesias. 
Additional experiments, however, are required to improve the survival and phenotypic stability of these cells before they can be considered useful for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a neurotoxic substrate of the dopamine transporter (DAT), is widely used in Parkinson's disease models.

A few of the compounds have been studied as pharmacotherapies for Parkinson's disease, ADHD, and obesity. 
 Iron and monoamine oxidase activity are increased in brain of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Iron chelators (desferal, Vk-28 and clioquinol) but not copper chelators have been shown to be neuroprotective in the 6-hydroxydoapmine and MPTP models of Parkinson's disease (PD), as are monoamine oxidase B inhibitors such as selegiline and rasagiline. 
 Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been implicated in the protection of dopamine (DA) neurons from oxidative stress in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Levodopa has been the gold standard for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy since it was successfully introduced in 1967.

It has been shown that placebo responses play a part in the effect of any type of treatment for Parkinson's disease, including drug therapy, deep brain stimulation and dopamine tissue transplantation. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is related to the release of substantial amounts of endogenous dopamine in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. 
 We investigated whether the cytokines produced in activated microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and putamen in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) are neuroprotective or neurotoxic. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease experience prominent difficulties in maintaining sleep, painful night-time abnormal movements, and daytime sleepiness, sometimes culminating in sleep attacks. 
 Rats lesioned shortly after birth with 6-hydroxydopamine are posed as a near-ideal model of severe Parkinson's disease, because of the non-lethality of the procedure, near-total destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibers, near-total dopamine (DA)-denervation of striatum, reproducibility of effect, and relative absence of overt behavioral effects--there is no aphasia, no adipsia, and no change in motor activity.

 The adenosine A(2A) receptor has recently emerged as a leading non-dopaminergic therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease, largely due to the restricted distribution of the receptor in the striatum and the profound interaction between adenosine and dopamine receptors in brain. 
Furthermore, Parkinson's disease model of rats receiving encapsulated PC12TH Tet-Off cells displayed a significant decrease of dopamine concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increase of the number of apomorphine-induced rotations by Dox-administration, as compared to transplanted rats without Dox-administration, although the significant decrease of the reduction ratio of DA concentration in the CSF with Dox-administration was recognized over time. 
Our results support both the value of cell therapy using Tet-Off system and the technique of encapsulation might be a feasible option for Parkinson's disease especially in resolving the problem of dopamine oversupply in the future, although a more efficient way to control DA-secretion with quicker regulation and much titration of dose should be explored before clinical application. 
Apomorphine (Apo), a dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor agonist, is used for clinical therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 To address the hypothesis that reactive astrocytes in the basal ganglia of an animal model of Parkinson's disease serve neurotrophic roles, we studied the expression pattern of neurotrophic factors in the basal ganglia of C57/Bl mice that had been treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce the degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons and parkinsonism. 
These nestin-expressing reactive astrocytes may therefore play neurotrophic roles in neural remodeling of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease.

 In the slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease very different neuronal populations undergo degenerative processes, although the cascades of cellular events leading to death are supposed to be similar. 
We suggest that the complex pattern of degeneration in Parkinson's disease depends on two processes, a 'primary neurodegeneration' that takes place in the striato-nigral dopamine neurons and a 'secondary degeneration', occurring in distant structures of the basal ganglia network. 
For Parkinson's disease this would mean that the metabolism of dopamine in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and presumably the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, together with one or more pathological factors contribute to the initial neurodegeneration. 
In Parkinson's disease, several structures distal from the substantia nigra pars compacta undergo neuropathological changes, characterizing the 'secondary neurodegeneration.

 Subjects with Parkinson's disease exhibit abnormally short compensatory steps in response to external postural perturbations. 
We examined whether: (1) Parkinson's disease subjects exhibit short compensatory steps due to abnormal central proprioceptive-motor integration, (2) this proprioceptive-motor deficit can be overcome by visual-motor neural circuits using visual targets, (3) the proprioceptive-motor deficit relates to the severity of Parkinson's disease, and (4) the dysfunction of central dopaminergic circuits contributes to the Parkinson's disease subjects' proprioceptive-motor deficit. 
Ten Parkinson's disease subjects and 10 matched control subjects performed compensatory steps in response to backward surface translations in five conditions: with eyes closed, with eyes open, to a remembered visual target, to a target without seeing their legs, and to a target while seeing their legs. 
Parkinson's disease subjects were separated into a moderate group and a severe group based on scores from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and were tested off and on their dopamine medication. 
Parkinson's disease subjects exhibited shorter compensatory steps than did the control subjects, but all subjects increased their step length when stepping to targets. 
Compared with the other subject groups, the severe Parkinson's disease subjects made larger accuracy errors when stepping to targets, and the severe Parkinson's disease subjects' step accuracy worsened the most when they were unable to see their legs. 
Thus, Parkinson's disease subjects exhibited short compensatory steps due to abnormal proprioceptive-motor integration and used visual input to take longer compensatory steps when a target was provided. 
In severe Parkinson's disease subjects, however, visual input does not fully compensate because, even with a target and unobstructed vision, they still exhibited poor step accuracy. 
Medication did not consistently improve the length and accuracy of the Parkinson's disease subjects' compensatory steps, suggesting that degeneration of dopamine circuits within the basal ganglia is not responsible for the proprioceptive-motor deficit that degrades compensatory steps in Parkinson's disease subjects.

Here, we report that the G-CSF receptor is expressed in rodent dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons, suggesting that G-CSF might be neuroprotective for dopaminergic neurons and a candidate molecule for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Specifically, we have made detailed comparisons of performance following basal ganglia disease such as Parkinson's disease, with other informative groups, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and structural damage to the frontal lobes themselves. 
However, if it is altered and accumulated it is involved in neurodegeneration as Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Abnormal function of NMDA receptor has been suggested to be correlated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as with the development of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. 
Individual differences in the central bioavailability of L-DOPA may provide a clue to the varying susceptibility to dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
The existence of this post-translational modification suggests new mechanisms of oxidative stress that may contribute to tissue degeneration, including loss of nigral dopamine neurons during normal aging and in Parkinson's disease. 
Mental and behavioral disorders associated with major disruptions of dopamine neurotransmission, including schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and substance abuse produce constellations of neuropsychological deficits in learning, memory, and attention in addition to other defining symptoms. 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with a progressive loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons. 
The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration have not been fully determined. 
In this study, the substantia nigra pars compacta neurodegenerative process was examined in the chronic mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model of Parkinson's disease treated with 10 doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (25 mg/kg) and probenecid (250 mg/kg) over five weeks. 
Cytomorphometric analysis of substantia nigra pars compacta nuclear loci revealed eccentric nucleoli dislocation and vesicular degranulation in all of the apoptotic neurons for the mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model for Parkinson's disease. 
In the one-day and seven-day post-treated mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model for Parkinson's disease, marked depression of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum was observed, which was correlated with significant reductions of striatal dopamine content and uptake. 
These results suggest that initial neuronal apoptosis and morphological changes are involved, at least in part, in the chronic neurodegeneration of mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid model for Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been linked to Parkinson's disease. 
Expression levels in striatal tissue did not differ between Parkinson's disease patients and control subjects. 
INTERPRETATION: Unlike all other genes so far linked to Parkinson's disease, our results demonstrate that LRRK2 expression is particularly high in brain dopaminoceptive areas. 
 BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is still debated whether or not I-FP-CIT single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) is able to differentiate between Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). 
Our aim was to use SPECT semiquantitative analysis to assess the capacity of I-FP-CIT to characterize Parkinson's disease versus PSP. 
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one Parkinson's disease patients, 15 disease duration- and age-matched PSP patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls were included in this study. 
The asymmetric index (AI) for the whole striatum was also calculated for Parkinson's disease and PSP. 
RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, S/O, C/O and P/O were significantly reduced (P<0.001) both in Parkinson's disease (-46%, -43%, -49%, contralaterally to the most affected side; -41%, -37%, -41%, ipsilaterally) and in PSP (-58%, -57%, -59%, contralaterally; -58%, -57%, -59%, ipsilaterally). 
S/O, C/O and P/O ratio values were significantly (P<0.001) lower in PSP patients when compared to Parkinson's disease group. 
The asymmetric index (AI) was significantly higher (P<0.001) in Parkinson's disease than in PSP (AI: 23.6%+/-15.07% vs. 
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that I-FP-CIT SPECT is clinically useful for detecting nigrostriatal degeneration both in Parkinson's disease and PSP. 
Moreover, in our series, semiquantitative analysis using I-FP-CIT SPECT allowed Parkinson's disease and PSP to be discriminated because PSP patients presented a more severe and symmetric dopamine transporter loss, and the results for S/O were more accurate. 
These results suggest that increased synchronised afferent activity may drive SNr oscillations in the same frequency band and is associated with abnormal involuntary movements, further suggesting the potential use of desynchronising drugs for managing LID in Parkinson's disease. 
 The dopamine (DA) precursor L-DOPA remains the most common treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian syndromes (eg, dementia with Lewy body disease, multisystem atrophy, and Shy-Drager syndrome) suffer from daytime sleepiness. 
 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The precise mechanism whereby continuous high-frequency electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus ameliorates motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease is unknown. 
Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced dopamine release within the basal ganglia may be an important mechanism whereby high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus improves motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 Fractal analysis was applied to human pallidal neuronal spike trains recorded from patients with Parkinson's disease during ablative surgery of the internal segment of the globus pallidus. 
This study was designed to elucidate its neuroprotective effects against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity (known as an in vivo mouse model of Parkinson's disease). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc), striatal dopamine deficiency and appearance of Lewy bodies. 
We investigated whether combined perfusion and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging can aid in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders: idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD), and essential tremor (ET).METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine patients were studied, retrospectively (69 males; 24 MSA, 12 PSP, 8 LBD, 27 ET, and 58 IPD; mean disease duration, 3.5 +/- 3.7 y). 
 Exposure to high levels of manganese (Mn) results in a neurological disorder, termed manganism, which shares a similar phenotype to Parkinson's disease due to the involvement of the basal ganglia circuitry in both. 
The initial symptoms of manganism are likely due to the involvement of the globus pallidus, a region rich in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) projections, while those of Parkinson's disease are related to the degeneration of the substantia nigra, a dopaminergic nucleus. 
 Medicated patients with Parkinsonism and parkin gene mutations have been reported to show a significant decrease in striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) in comparison to medicated idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients with similar age and disease severity. 
Results of several clinical trials demonstrated that the rotigotine transdermal system is safe, well tolerated and effective monotherapy for patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease.

R-(-)-Deprenyl (deprenyl) ameliorates the progression of disability in early Parkinson's disease and also has neuroprotective actions. 
melrose.heather@mayo.edu  Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have recently been identified in autosomal dominant late-onset Parkinson's disease. 
We find LRRK2 is highly expressed in the striatum, cortex and olfactory tubercle; however, little or no expression is found in the substantia nigra, where dopaminergic neurons preferentially degenerate in Parkinson's disease. 
Consistent with a role LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease, dysfunction of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 protein in dopamine-innervated areas may to lead to altered dopaminergic neurotransmission and degeneration of the nigro-striatal pathway. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), several neurotransmitter systems, such as the dopaminergic and serotonergic system, show signs of degeneration. 
 Toxin-induced animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit many of the same neuroinflammatory changes seen in patients suggesting a role for inflammation in DA neuron loss.

In recent years it has been asserted that neurological and neurobehavioural disorders may develop consequent to exposure to steel welding fumes and that employment as a welder is associated with the unusually early onset of Parkinson's disease. 
Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is a common disorder affecting 1-2% of those in the general population aged >65 years. 
This may be biologically feasible if manganese destroys insufficient receptor cells to produce clinical manganism but sufficient to enhance the effects of a reduced supply of dopamine to give the manifestations of already developing idiopathic Parkinson's disease earlier in the course of destruction of the substantia nigra than if all receptors were intact. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and is generally viewed as a potential target for stem cell therapy. 
 BACKGROUND: Progressive reduction of the dose of one dopamine receptor agonist and simultaneous, progressive dose escalation of another is a frequently used strategy for controlling motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) or avoiding specific adverse events. 
 Compelling evidence suggests a monoaminergic dysfunction in the aetiology of various neuro-psychiatric diseases such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, addiction and Parkinson's disease. 
These results not only establish oxidative stress as one of the major causative factors underlying dopaminergic neurodegeneration as observed in Parkinson's disease, but also support the view that deprenyl is a potent free radical scavenger and an antioxidant. 
 The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease rests on the identification of the characteristics related to dopamine deficiency that are a consequence of degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
Indeed, non-motor symptoms dominate the clinical picture of advanced Parkinson's disease and contribute to severe disability, impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. 
Inevitably, the development of treatments that can slow or prevent the progression of Parkinson's disease and its multicentric neurodegeneration provides the best hope of curing non-motor symptoms. 
This study confirms that the corridor test is highly sensitive to dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, and suggests that it might be a useful tool for screening pharmacological approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Elevated level of this molecule in the blood of Parkinson's disease patients receiving long-term l-DOPA therapy prompted us to investigate whether homocysteine is neurotoxic to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Sprague-Dawley rats. 
 Pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease is focused on dopaminergic drugs, mainly the dopamine precursor levodopa and dopamine receptor agonists. 
The long-duration of response to levodopa, which is evident in early Parkinson's disease, diminishes and after a few years of treatment motor performance is closely correlated to the fluctuating plasma concentrations of levodopa. 
Absorption of levodopa in the proximal small intestine depends on gastric emptying, which is erratic and may be slowed in Parkinson's disease. 
To conclude, several new drugs, formulations and routes of administration have been introduced in the treatment of Parkinson's disease during the last decade, mainly with CDS as the aim.

These findings may be useful in elucidating the actual mechanism of free radical formation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injuries. 
 Since the introduction of dopamine replacement therapy using L-3,4-dihydroxyphenyalanine (L-DOPA) to treat Parkinson's disease and the recognition of the problems associated with L-DOPA use, numerous studies have investigated dopamine receptor regulation and function in Parkinson's disease. 
These studies have provided insight into the pathological process of the disorder and the molecular consequences of chronic dopaminergic treatment, but they have been less successful in identifying new pharmacological targets or treatment regimes that are as effective as L-DOPA at alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Here we show that the homeodomain proteins Lmx1a and Msx1 function as determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons, cells that degenerate in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These data establish that Lmx1a and Msx1 are critical intrinsic dopamine-neuron determinants in vivo and suggest that they may be essential tools in cell replacement strategies in Parkinson's disease.

We analysed the association between degeneration and humoral immune markers in brain tissue of patients with idiopathic (n = 13) or genetic (n = 2 with alpha-synuclein and n = 1 with parkin mutations) Parkinson's disease and controls without neurological disease (n = 12) to determine the humoral immune involvement in Parkinson's disease. 
Significant dopamine neuron loss occurred in all patients with Parkinson's disease, negatively correlating with disease duration (r = -0.76, P = 0.002). 
All patients with Parkinson's disease had IgG binding on dopamine neurons but not IgM binding. 
A mean 30 +/- 12% of dopamine nigral neurons were immunoreactive for IgG in Parkinson's disease with the proportion of IgG immunopositive neurons negatively correlating with the degree of cell loss in the substantia nigra (r = -0.67, P < 0.0001) and positively correlating with the number of HLA immunopositive microglia (r = 0.51, P = 0.01).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on chart review, patients with Parkinson's disease whose bed partners have reported prominent motor activity while dreaming were identified. 
Clinical features of these patients concerning Hoehn-Yahr stage of PD, the severity of PD according to the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), the mean dose and duration of levodopa (LD) therapy, the presence of motor complications were compared with those of gender and age at PD-onset matched 35 PD patients without RBD (NRBD group).

Consequently, it has been suggested that isatin might be a possible treatment for Parkinson's disease although little is known about its effects on neural cell growth and survival. 
Our results re-emphasise that caution should be exercised when considering high doses of isatin as a putative anti-Parkinson's disease therapeutic. 
 (1) If patients with Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa develop end-of-dose motor fluctuations, the standard therapy is to add bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, to their ongoing treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: Anticholinergic drugs are classified as secondary options in the treatment of sialorrhea of patients with Parkinson's disease or cerebral palsy, owing to the relevant side effects occurring during prolonged treatments. 
 In Parkinson's disease, dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is characterized by severe dopamine addiction and behavioral disorders such as manic psychosis, hypersexuality, pathological gambling, and mood swings. 
Dopaminergic addiction in patients with Parkinson's disease, therefore, does not constitute an obstacle to high-frequency STN stimulation, and this treatment may even cure the addiction.

 Levodopa is the main pharmacologic treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 Ropinirole (Requip, GlaxoSmithKline) is a novel nonergoline dopamine D2 agonist indicated for the treatment of early and advanced Parkinson's disease. 
When used as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease, ropinirole improves signs and symptoms of the disorder. 
When used as an adjunct to levodopa in advanced Parkinson's disease patients with motor fluctuations, ropinirole reduces off time and allows a reduction of levodopa dose. 
The initial use of ropinirole in early Parkinson's disease to which levodopa is added when necessary, has been demonstrated to lead to a lower incidence of dyskinesias compared with treatment with levodopa alone. 
 Ropinirole is an original nonergoline dopamine agonist indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 BACKGROUND AND AIM: 123I-FP-CIT SPECT has been successfully used to detect the loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease at an early stage. 
In this study we evaluated the capacity of 123I-FP-CIT SPECT to assess bilateral dopamine transporter (DAT) loss in de-novo hemi-Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with one-sided clinical symptoms. 
In this study, we examined whether they are also effective against the toxicity caused by 6-hydroxydopamine, both in vivo and in vitro, which may be relevant to Parkinson's disease (PD). 
They provide further evidence that behavioral sensitization and dyskinesia induced by a chronic administration of L-DOPA in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease is paralleled by a plasticity of GABA-mediated signaling in the SNr. 
It has been suggested that various forms of neuropsychiatric disease, in particular, Parkinson's disease (PD), is consequentially related to this decrease by virtue of increased oxidative stress which enhances the process of dopamine (DA) degeneration. 
 Although L-DOPA is the drug of choice for Parkinson's disease, prolonged L-DOPA therapy results in decreased drug effectiveness and the appearance of motor complications. 
This is now the basis of a proposed therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease.

Hitler's mood swings, Parkinson's disease, gastro-intestinal symptoms, skin problems and steady decline until his suicide in 1945 are documented by reliable observers and historians, and in Morell's diaries. 
 Multiple genetic deficits have linked impaired ubiquitin-conjugation pathways to various forms of familiar Parkinson's disease. 
We therefore examined the possible role of 6-hydroxydopamine, a dopaminergic neurotoxin used in Parkinson's disease experimental models, in causing protein degradation and its association with the ubiquitin proteasome system. 
These results suggest that denervation of dopamine neurons per se is implicated in the regulation of ubiquitin pathways, at least in a classical animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
This study adds additional information regarding the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in Parkinson's disease. 
 Loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) initiates a complex stream of effects that results in the development of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity.

 The purpose of this study was to investigate whether locomotor training could ameliorate neurochemical changes and behavioral deficits in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that treadmill training does not ameliorate locomotor deficits in the 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease, even though this same training results in attenuation of dopamine loss in the striatum. 
 Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of untreated patients implanted with stimulation electrodes for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) demonstrate strong coherence with the cortical electroencephalogram over the beta-frequency range (15-30 Hz). 
 Excessive synchronization of neural activity in the beta frequency band ( approximately 20 Hz) within basal ganglia circuits might contribute to the paucity and slowness of movement in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
High levels of zif-268, together with a persistent hyperresponsiveness of striatonigral dymorphinergic neurons and hyporesponsiveness of striatopallidal neurons, by creating an unbalanced state of striatal efferent neurons, may be implicated in dyskinetic movements observed in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Thus, DJ-1 protects against neuronal oxidative stress, and loss of DJ-1 may lead to Parkinson's disease by conferring hypersensitivity to dopaminergic insults. 
Interest in this pigment has seen a resurgence in recent years because of a hypothesised link between neuromelanin and the especial vulnerability of neuromelanin-containing neurons to cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Recent data from neuromelanin in the Parkinson's disease brain suggests that this proposed function may be compromised, thus rendering pigmented neurons vulnerable to oxidative damage in this disorder.

 Converging lines of evidence suggest that neuroinflammatory processes may account for the progressive death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In addition, DA is a reactive molecule that has been implicated in neurodegeneration, especially in Parkinson's disease.

Experimental evidence based on the combined paraquat + maneb model of the Parkinson's disease (PD) phenotype summarized here provides support for such an assertion. 
On the basis of L: -DOPA therapy in animal models of Parkinson's disease, it appears that L: -DOPA is actually neuroprotective, not neurotoxic, as indicated by L: -DOPA's reducing striatal tissue content of the reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radical (HO(*)), and by leaving unaltered the extraneuronal in vivo microdialysate level of HO(*).

To test for these biasing effects, we have used a constrained compartmental analysis to calculate the brain concentrations of the plasma metabolite 3-O-methyl-FDOPA (OMFD) during 120 mins of FDOPA circulation in healthy young, healthy elderly, and Parkinson's disease subjects. 
The effective distribution volume (EDV(2); K/k(loss)) for FDOPA, an index of dopamine storage capacity in brain, was reduced by 85% in putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease, and by 58% in the healthy elderly relative to the healthy young control subjects. 
Results of the present study support claims that storage capacity for dopamine in both caudate and putamen is more profoundly impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease than is the capacity for DOPA utilization, calculated by conventional FDOPA net influx plots.

 The reason for the high frequency of depression and anxiety in Parkinson's disease is poorly understood. 
We studied eight and 12 Parkinson's disease patients with and without a history of depression matched for age, disease duration and doses of antiparkinsonian medication. 
The depressed Parkinson's disease cohort had lower [11C]RTI-32 binding than non-depressed Parkinson's disease cases in the locus coeruleus and in several regions of the limbic system including the anterior cingulate cortex, the thalamus, the amygdala and the ventral striatum. 
Exploratory analyses revealed that the severity of anxiety in the Parkinson's disease patients was inversely correlated with the [11C]RTI-32 binding in most of these regions and apathy was inversely correlated with [11C]RTI-32 binding in the ventral striatum. 
These results suggest that depression and anxiety in Parkinson's disease might be associated with a specific loss of dopamine and noradrenaline innervation in the limbic system.

In this study, we demonstrate that an antisense oligonucleotide infusion (200 nM for 28 days) to prevent BDNF production in the substantia nigra of rats mimics many features of the classical animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, reduced BDNF mRNA expression in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra may contribute directly to the death of nigral dopaminergic neurons and the development of Parkinson's disease. 
 Adult male Wistar rats with bilateral substantia nigra, pars compacta (SNc) lesion induced by intranigral administration of 0.5 mumol 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were used as a model of early phase Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) has been implicated in schizophrenia, drug addiction, depression and Parkinson's disease. 
This effect is greatly reduced for A53T alpha-synuclein, which is a mutant associated with familial Parkinson's disease.

This study assessed the effect of levodopa on the rate of progression of Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated 361 patients with early Parkinson's disease who were assigned to receive carbidopa-levodopa at a daily dose of 37.5 and 150 mg, 75 and 300 mg, or 150 and 600 mg, respectively, or a matching placebo for a period of 40 weeks, and then to undergo withdrawal of treatment for 2 weeks. 
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical data suggest that levodopa either slows the progression of Parkinson's disease or has a prolonged effect on the symptoms of the disease. 
The potential long-term effects of levodopa on Parkinson's disease remain uncertain.

If so, one would predict that disruption of the midbrain dopamine system--such as occurs in Parkinson's disease--may lead to deficits on tasks that rely upon such learning processes. 
These findings suggest that the loss of dopamine that occurs in Parkinson's disease can lead to specific learning impairments that are predicted by electrophysiological and computational studies, and that enhancing dopamine levels with L-dopa alleviates this deficit.

These findings may further the understanding of how ERT is associated with improvement in Parkinson's disease and late-onset schizophrenia. 
These data suggest that I(2)-specific ligands have dual effects in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease; a first effect associated with an increase in activity in the intact hemisphere, probably via an increase in striatal dopamine content, and a secondary action which, through the previously documented inhibition of MAO-A and/or MAO-B, increases the availability of dopamine produced by L-DOPA.

 The dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is abnormally active in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Whether abnormal PMd activity influences excitability in the primary motor cortex (M1) in untreated Parkinson's disease patients and how this premotor-motor interaction might be altered by l-dopa is unclear. 
To this end, we studied the effects of 1 Hz premotor repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on M1 excitability in 10 previously untreated non-tremulous Parkinson's disease patients before (day 1) and after (day 8) their first ever l-dopa treatment and compared the results with those of a group of nine age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

In Parkinson's disease patients, abnormal baseline intracortical excitability at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 5 ms was normalized by premotor rTMS. 
These results show that the modifiability of premotor-motor connections is abnormal in untreated Parkinson's disease. 
normalized, the direction of excitability changes in M1 following premotor rTMS in Parkinson's disease patients, suggesting that dopamine depletion directly or indirectly influences premotor-motor interactions in Parkinson's disease. 
The rTMS conditioning approach described here provides a promising tool to delineate further the excitability changes in frontal motor areas in response to progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and also to chronic l-dopa treatment in Parkinson's disease.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy versus active comparators in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications. 
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of adjuvant COMT inhibitor therapy versus an active comparator in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy. 
The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
Further larger and longer-term trials are required to compare tolcapone with entacapone and COMT inhibitor therapy with alternative adjuvant classes of drug in later Parkinson's disease such as dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 
Also, dihydrexidine was the first dopamine D(1) receptor agonist that had potent antiparkinsonian activity in a primate model of Parkinson's disease.

In the present study, we use a chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease to investigate astrocytes and their relationship to glutamate, its extracellular level, synaptic localization, and transport. 
Although reactive astrocytes are important for maintaining homeostasis, changes in their ability to regulate glutamate and its associated synaptic functions could be important for the progressive nature of the pathophysiology associated with Parkinson's disease.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the possible advantage resulting from a more sustained dopaminergic effect of cabergoline would translate into delayed onset of motor complications, compared with levodopa, in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a double-blind, multicentre trial that compared cabergoline and levodopa as initial therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
A total of 419 levodopa-, DA- and selegiline-naive patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease were randomised to receive either cabergoline (n = 211) or levodopa (n = 209). 
CONCLUSION: This study showed that, compared with levodopa, initial therapy with cabergoline in patients with Parkinson's disease is associated with a lower risk of response fluctuations at the cost of a marginally reduced symptomatic improvement and some tolerability disadvantages that are mostly limited to a significantly higher frequency of peripheral oedema. 
 Peak-dose dyskinesias are abnormal movements that usually occur 1 h after oral administration of levodopa, and often complicate chronic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
We investigated by PET with [11C]raclopride whether Parkinson's disease progression modifies the striatal changes in synaptic dopamine levels induced by levodopa administration, and whether this modification, if present, could have an impact on the emergence of dyskinesias. 
We found that, 1 h after oral administration of standard-release 250/25 mg of levodopa/carbidopa, levodopa-induced increases in synaptic dopamine levels (as estimated by striatal changes in [11C]raclopride binding potential) correlated positively with duration of Parkinson's disease symptoms (for the caudate nucleus, r = 0.79, P < 0.001; for the putamen, r = 0.88, P < 0.0001). 
The corresponding (time x group) interaction term in the repeated measures analysis of covariance was significant, even after adjusting for between-group differences in duration of Parkinson's disease symptoms (for the caudate nucleus, P = 0.030; for the putamen, P = 0.021). 
Our results indicate that, at the synaptic level, an identical dose of levodopa induces increasingly larger 1-h changes in dopamine levels as Parkinson's disease progresses. 
Large levodopa-induced increases in synaptic dopamine concentration can lead to dramatic changes in receptor occupancy, which may be responsible for the emergence of peak-dose dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.

 Apomorphine, a short-acting dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonist, was the first dopamine receptor agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
Subcutaneous apomorphine is currently used for the management of sudden, unexpected and refractory levodopa-induced 'off' states in fluctuating Parkinson's disease either as intermittent rescue injections or continuous infusions. 
The efficacy of intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections as an add-on to levodopa therapy in advanced Parkinson's disease was explored in one short-term, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, one short-term and six long-term, open-label, uncontrolled studies, including a total of 195 patients. 
These studies provide evidence that this mode of administration was successful in aborting 'off' periods and improving Parkinson's disease motor scores, but tended to increase dyskinesias. 
Eleven long-term, open-label, uncontrolled studies, including a total of 233 patients evaluated the efficacy of continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions in monotherapy or as an add-on to levodopa therapy in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
These studies proved that subcutaneous apomorphine infusions are successful in aborting 'off' periods, reducing dyskinesias and improving Parkinson's disease motor scores with the added benefit of a substantial levodopa-sparing effect. 
The apomorphine challenge test has at least 80% overall predictive ability to clinically diagnose Parkinson's disease across the different stages of the disease and parkinsonian syndromes. 
Similarly, those data also indicate that the apomorphine challenge test has a >80% ability to predict dopaminergic responsiveness across all stages of Parkinson's disease. 
Based on the results of these studies it is recommended that subcutaneous apomorphine either as intermittent injections or continuous infusions should be offered to any suitable Parkinson's disease patient who has difficulties in his/her management with conventional therapy.

 This review deals with the range of neuropsychiatric problems that may arise from the use of medical and surgical therapies in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 Mitochondrial oxidative stress is thought to be an important pathological mediator of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. 
We tested the idea that neuronal damage in the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model of Parkinson's disease results, in part, from superoxide radical toxicity via inactivation of an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein, mitochondrial aconitase. 
These results suggest that mitochondrial aconitase may be an important early source of mitochondrial iron accumulation in experimental Parkinson's disease, and that superoxide radical toxicity manifested by oxidative inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase may play a pathogenic role in Parkinson's disease. 
The availability of unlimited numbers of midbrain DA neurons is a first step toward exploring the potential of hES cells in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of imaging of dopamine transporters with 99mTc-TRODAT-1 in early diagnosis or differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
Twenty-nine patients with Parkinson's disease, 12 age-matched healthy volunteers, and 18 age-matched patients with Parkinson's syndrome were investigated.

 Evidence suggests that nicotinic receptors play a role in nigrostriatal function, a finding that may be relevant to Parkinson's disease.

 One of the most disabling problems in males suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex sexual dysfunction. 
 In addition to the dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system, the properties of dopaminergic neurons in the mesolimbic system, such as the amygdala, are also of interest and importance because of their specific neuromodulatory effects in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD).

RECENT FINDINGS: The classical role of positron emission tomography and radioligands such as F-dopa and C-raclopride for investigating abnormalities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic system underlying Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington's disease has recently been made more powerful by the application of statistical mapping to localize changes in dopamine storage capacity and receptor binding across the whole brain at a voxel level. 
The application of this model in assessing dopamine changes in response to pharmacological, behavioural, motor task and magnetic stimulation in normal individuals and Parkinson's disease patients is reviewed. 
Recent studies using positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography to discriminate Parkinson's disease from essential tremor and Parkinsonism, the involvement of non-dopaminergic systems in Parkinson's disease and the role of cell transplantation in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are also discussed. 
SUMMARY: Functional imaging techniques provide insight into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, and Huntington's disease and the mechanisms of the progression of these diseases. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Marked olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia) is a frequent and early abnormality in Parkinson's disease. 
RECENT FINDINGS: Marked olfactory dysfunction occurs in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies but is not found in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.

Refinement of clinical strategies to predict, identify and manage this syndrome will aid the future treatment of motor and non-motor complications of Parkinson's disease. 
 The catecholamine-oxidizing enzyme monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) has been hypothesized to be an important determining factor in the etiology of both normal aging and age-related neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Neural progenitor cells have shown the effectiveness in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but the therapeutic efficacy remains variable. 
This study therefore investigated the therapeutic efficacy of mesencephalon-derived human neural progenitor cells with or without the pre-differentiation in alleviating a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These data demonstrates the importance of pre-differentiation of human progenitor cells before transplantation in enhancing therapeutic potency for Parkinson's disease.

These data support gender stratification in the evaluation of mechanisms and treatment of CNS disease, particularly those where glutathione may play a role in detoxification, such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and conditions producing cerebral ischemia, and may apply to non-CNS diseases as well. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent age-related motor dysfunction resulting from the hyperactivity of the indirect striatal pathway, which is controlled in an antagonistic manner by inhibitory dopamine D2 and facilitatory adenosine A(2A) receptors. 
 Alpha synuclein protein may play an important role in familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease pathology. 
 An understanding of the regulators of neurogenesis in the normal and diseased brain is necessary in order to recruit endogenously produced neural precursors for cell replacement in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
Here, we show in adult mice that destruction of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease reduced the number of proliferating neural precursors in the subventricular zone of the anterior lateral ventricle by approximately 40%. 
This identifies dopamine as one of the few known endogenous regulators of adult neurogenesis with implications for the potential use of endogenous neural precursors in cell replacement strategies for Parkinson's disease. 
 The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been implicated in movement disorders observed in Parkinson's disease because of its pathological mixed burst firing mode and hyperactivity. 
 Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disease with a reduction of dopamine levels causing the typical symptoms tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, and postural disturbance. 
After some years with Parkinson's disease patients tend to develop fluctuating symptoms and dyskinesia with involuntary movements--a state difficult to manage.

EXEGESIS: Current gene therapy models for Parkinson's disease have focused on two strategies. 
CONCLUSION: Neuroprotection and restoration of the nigrostriatal pathway are important issues for future genetic treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease and could include, in addition to neurotrophic factors, genes to prevent apoptosis or detoxify free radical species. 
 GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor expressed in mammalian brain, and its insoluble aggregates are found in the brain samples of juvenile Parkinson's disease patients. 
These functional alterations are not associated with any substantial loss of substantia nigra neurons or degeneration of striatal dopaminergic afferences, the main histological marks of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is a chronic progressive condition that causes disability and reduction of quality of life. 
However, as our basic and clinical knowledge on Parkinson's disease increases, it is likely that a neuroprotective drug will be found. 
 Minocycline has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects underlying its putative neuroprotective properties in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease and in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD). 
We report deleterious effects of minocycline in two phenotypic (toxic) models of Parkinson's disease and HD in monkey and mouse. 
An important and specific role of GRKs and beta arrestins in regulating physiological responsiveness to psychostimulants and morphine suggests potential involvement of these molecules in certain brain disorders, such as addiction, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. 
Taken together with previous observations, this study suggests that nestin-expressing activated astroglial cells, possibly partially through synthesizing and releasing neurotrophic factors such as BDNF in the basal ganglia, may play important roles in protection of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in mammals. 
 We have evaluated the potential neuroprotectant activity of minocycline in an animal model of Parkinson's disease induced by intranigral injection of lipopolysaccharide. 
If inflammation is proved to be involved in the ethiopathology of Parkinson's disease, our data support the use of minocycline in parkinsonian patients.

 The neuropathology associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) is thought to involve excessive production of free radicals, dopamine autoxidation, defects in glutathione peroxidase expression, attenuated levels of reduced glutathione, altered calcium homeostasis, excitotoxicity and genetic defects in mitochondrial complex I activity. 
 To date, the lack of highly selective antagonists at the dopamine D(3) receptor has hampered clarification of their involvement in the actions of currently used therapies in Parkinson's disease. 
Selectivity for stimulation of D(2), over D(3), receptors may therefore be a beneficial property of dopamine receptor agonists in management of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease patients with established dyskinesia. 
 We have investigated the potential of autologous sympathetic neurons as a donor for cell therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 One experimental therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is the transplantation of embryonic ventral mesencephalic tissue. 
 Dopaminergic cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the potential of which is limited due to poor survival and low dopamine content within engrafted tissue.

 The alpha-synuclein gene is implicated in Parkinson's disease, the symptoms of which occur after a marked loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons.

 Dopamine agonists are increasingly being used in the initial treatment of patients with de-novo Parkinson's disease because they provide symptom relief and a low risk of the dyskinesia frequently associated with levodopa. 
Ergot derivatives, such as pergolide, induce minor side-effects and provide significant and sustained improvements in motor function in patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
Dopamine agonists also appear to reduce the loss of functional dopamine transporters when used early in the disease course, and these factors combine to build a case for the use of dopamine agonists in early-stage Parkinson's disease. 
 Pergolide is one of the most well-tested and widely used dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, there is worrying evidence that sub-therapeutic dosing of pergolide is widespread in clinical practice. 
Whether pergolide is used early in patients with de-novo Parkinson's disease or as adjunctive therapy later in the disease, in order to optimize its clinical efficacy, it is recommended that practitioners aim to achieve at least these doses, or higher ones, if the drug is well tolerated. 
 Dopamine agonists are effective in the management of both advanced and early-stage Parkinson's disease. 
Indirect comparisons of dopamine agonists show that ergot derivatives, such as pergolide and cabergoline, are as effective as non-ergot derivatives, such as ropinirole and pramipexole, in ameliorating Parkinson's disease symptoms in patients in early or advanced stages of the condition.

Since Parkinson's disease results in tremor, rigidity, and an inability to initiate voluntary movement, and since the cells are localized in the basal ganglia, a region with the primary motor mechanism of the sub-mammalian brain, dopamine was initially identified with motor function. 
 Problems associated with long-term treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) include motor complications and psychotic and autonomic symptoms. 
Since during the ageing process, pathological effects may occur in vulnerable structures not only from disturbances to cerebral blood-perfusion but also from enrichment of iron in vulnerable structures (Connor, 1992) the question arose whether this situation did not reveal pathological mechanisms that might triggered the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Previous studies suggested that normal [18F]Dopa positron emission tomography or [123I]beta-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, indicating intact structural integrity of nigrostriatal neurons, may be useful for differentiating HPD/DRD from clinically similar conditions such as juvenile Parkinson's disease with dystonia that have a considerably poorer prognosis. 
Interest in dopamine's additional contributions to normal and pathologic sleep-wake states has experienced a recent rebirth originating from two clinical disorders: Parkinson's disease and Restless Legs Syndrome.

This strategy of isolation and transplantation of ES-cell-derived DA neurons should be useful for cellular and molecular studies of DA neurons and for clinical application in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
However, there is now growing optimism that neural transplant therapies may one day enable complete circuit reconstruction and thus functional benefit for patients with neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD), and perhaps even those with more widespread damage such as stroke patients. 
Indeed, since the late 1980s hundreds of patients with Parkinson's disease have received allografts of dopamine-rich embryonic human neural tissue. 
 Levodopa (l-dopa) therapy is still considered the gold-standard in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
To address this issue, we analysed the physiological and pharmacological properties of striatal glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease. 
We suggest that the reversal of striatal glutamatergic overactivity and the normalization of hypersensitive D2 DA receptors modulating excitatory transmission might underlie some of the therapeutic actions of l-dopa in Parkinson's disease.

 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although the cognitive deficits of idiopathic Parkinson's disease are now relatively well known, their neuropsychological and neurobiological basis are still discussed. 
The present review focuses on data from studies in Parkinson's disease in order to define the role played by the dopaminergic system in episodic memory and procedural learning. 
The pattern of episodic memory disturbances in Parkinson's disease is very specific: Parkinson's disease patients display a preserved ability to encode, store and consolidate new information but have difficulties in retrieving it. 
On procedural learning tasks, Parkinson's disease patients display a lower progressive performance enhancement over trials than healthy controls. 
Other neurotransmission systems are probably involved in the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, and currently it is the cholinergic hypothesis that is the most considered. 
For example, in Parkinson's disease, besides motor impairment, dopamine degeneration is also expressed by alterations of both limbic, executive and cognitive functions, both improved by dopamine receptor agonists and dopa therapy. 
 Nigral dopaminergic projections to the striatum are targeted in Parkinson's disease (PD).

In this study, we show that prevention of PARP activation by treatment with FR261529 [2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-quinoxalinecarboxamide], the compound that was recently identified as a novel PARP inhibitor (IC50 for PARP-1 = 33 nM, IC50 for PARP-2 = 7 nM), protects against both ROS-induced cells injury in vitro and METH-induced dopaminergic neuronal damage in an in vivo Parkinson's disease (PD) model. 
In this report, protein profiling was used for the first time to generate peptide and protein profiles of brain tissue sections obtained from experimental Parkinson's disease (unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine treated rats). 
The present study shows that unique protein profiles can be obtained in specific brain regions (and subregions) directly on brain tissue sections and allows for the study of complex biochemical processes such as those occurring in experimental Parkinson's disease. 
These actions point to a tight association of the cannabinoid system with the brain dopaminergic circuits involved in addiction, the clinical manifestation of positive symptoms of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

 The most effective treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is, at present, the dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), however a number of disadvantages such as a loss of drug efficacy and severe side-effects (psychoses, dyskinesias and on-off phenomena) limit long-term effective utilisation of this drug.

In this chapter, we review evidence that (1) HO-1 is overexpressed in CNS tissues affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other degenerative and nondegenerative CNS diseases; (2) the pro-oxidant effects of dopamine, hydrogen peroxide, beta-amyloid, and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate HO-1 expression in some of these conditions; and (3) upregulation of HO-1 in astrocytes exacerbates intracellular oxidative stress and promotes sequestration of nontransferrin-derived iron by the mitochondrial compartment. 
 A 72-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease referred to the Dental Hospital of Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, presented with movement of an implant-supported prosthesis, slight pain, and purulent drainage from the gingiva in the anterior region of the maxilla, where implants had been placed more than 20 years earlier. 
In addition to Parkinson's disease the patient had a severe gag reflex, which made treatment difficult. 
The results of this case indicate that use of regional anesthesia in combination with midazolam can be recommended for implant surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa remains the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Degenerative process in Parkinson's disease affects substantia nigra and other central structures of an extrapyramidal system but it can also affect central and peripheral autonomic centres.

Pharmacologic treatment modification (more frequent levodopa dosage, additional dopamine agonist) resulted in some improvement.CONCLUSION: It is possible that the abdominal pains could be a clinical manifestation of a digestive tract dyskinesias, occurring during  The aim of the reports is to emphasize difficulty in treatment of Parkinson's disease in patients with surgical problems. 
 The pathogenesis of the motor fluctuations and dyskinesias that complicate levodopa treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) remains uncertain.

 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulty in processing learning tasks that lack external guidelines and, consequently, necessitate the subjects to generate their own problem-solving strategy. 
 Recent neuroimaging studies indicate that placebo treatments can induce clinically relevant neurobiological responses in patients with Parkinson's disease, depression and pain. 
Many recent studies have agreed on the remarkable finding that all patients with Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension have a loss of cardiac sympathetic innervation, whereas all patients with multiple system atrophy, often difficult to distinguish clinically from Parkinson's disease, have intact cardiac sympathetic innervation. 
Because Parkinson's disease entails a postganglionic sympathetic noradrenergic lesion, the disease appears to be not only a movement disorder, with dopamine loss in the nigrostriatal system of the brain, but also a dysautonomia, with noradrenaline loss in the sympathetic nervous system of the heart. 
 Since Parkinson's disease (PD) patients could suffer from a reward deficiency syndrome, they are particularly prone to develop addictive behaviours. 
Such studies may also elucidate the contribution of noradrenergic dysfunction to a variety of symptoms in Parkinson's disease and other degenerative neurological disorders. 
In conclusion, cabergoline protects in vitro neurons against ischemia-induced cell death, suggesting its possible use in the therapy of other neurodegenerative diseases in addition to Parkinson's disease.

 CONTEXT: This study was part of a large double-blind sham surgery-controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of transplantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the brains of persons with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
PARTICIPANTS: A volunteer sample of 40 persons with idiopathic Parkinson's disease participated in the transplant ("parent") study, and 30 agreed to participate in the related QOL study: 12 received the transplant and 18 received sham surgery. 
 To determine whether the adenosine A2A receptor might play a role in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease, we analyzed changes in the expression of A2A receptor mRNA in response to intermittent treatment with L-DOPA in rats with dopaminergic denervation by 6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA) infusion into the medial forebrain bundle. 
In both groups, ten patients with normal presynaptic function were included as a control population; all other patients were clinically diagnosed as having idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease, a major neurodegenerative disorder in humans whose etiology is unknown, may be associated with some environmental factors. 
Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (GAM-5) isolated from a patient with an actinomycetoma produced signs similar to Parkinson's disease following iv injection into NMRI mice. 
Our observations emphasize the need for further studies of the potential association between Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism-like disease and exposure to various nocardial species. 
They are also targets for abused and therapeutic drugs and play pivotal roles in neurological disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. 
The aggregation of alpha-synuclein is associated with Parkinson's disease, and the aggregation of the Abeta peptide is associated with Alzheimer's disease. 
 Numerous research has pointed out that serotonin2c (5-HT2C) receptor, a subtype of 5-HT receptors belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, modulates the activity of mesencephalic dopamine (DA) neurons, the dysfunction of which is involved in devastating diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and drug addiction. 
 alpha-Synuclein is a key component of the pathological process of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
The regulatory role of alpha-synuclein on dopamine metabolism is assessed by discussing the experimental evidence supporting each of these observations in the healthy physiological maintenance of dopaminergic neurons, as well as showing how disruption of these events can initiate the observed neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein and the genesis of the degenerative processes associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Interest in alpha-syn has increased dramatically after the discovery of a relationship between its dysfunction and several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The pathology of Parkinson's disease involves oxidative damage to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. 
Thus, the results of our study further provide evidence that BH4, the molecule endogenously present in the dopaminergic neurons, may participate in the nigrostriatal degeneration as in Parkinson's disease.

 Pain is reported by nearly 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Nonspecific pains of Parkinson's disease can be difficult to treat. 
In untreated early disease, generalized pain or pain related to joint or muscle immobility may be reduced by effective treatment of the underlying Parkinson's disease. 
 For therapeutic and prognostic reasons it is important to differentiate between idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS, Parkinson's disease) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) like multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy. 
 The efficacy of oral L-dopa becomes problematic with the progression of Parkinson's disease, due in large part to a lost ability to accommodate L-dopa's inherently poor pharmacokinetics. 
In a rat model of Parkinson's disease (unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion), the pulmonary formulation of L-dopa (0.5-2.0 mg) yielded more rapid and robust elevations in striatal L-dopa, dopamine, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels, as well as 2.5 to 3.7 times as many c-fos-expressing striatal neurons. 
 Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) may develop a variety of motor complications associated with levodopa therapy.

 We started the subject screening from over 400 patients with Parkinson's disease using strict selection criteria to identify the patients with nocturia who would allow accurate and efficient evaluation of the pergolide effects. 
Our study also suggests that switching from bromocriptine to pergolide improves nocturia, thereby improving sleep status of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Prompted by the findings that smokers have lowered brain and blood platelet monoamine oxidase-A and -B activities compared to non-smokers and that smokers have a lowered incidence of Parkinson's disease, we have examined the neuroprotective properties of an MAO inhibitor, 2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (TMN), which is present in the tobacco plant and smoke in the MPTP C57BL/6 mouse model of neurodegeneration. 
Dopamine (DA) levels in the striata of mice treated with TMN prior to the administration of MPTP were significantly higher than DA levels in the striata of mice receiving MPTP only, thus indicating a degree of neuroprotection in this model of Parkinson's disease. 
Although there is no evidence to link the lowered activities of MAO to the lowered incidence of Parkinson's disease in smokers, the neuroprotective effects of TMN in the MPTP mouse model suggest that such a relationship is worthy of further evaluation. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra projecting to striatum. 
 Brain adenosine A2A receptors have recently attracted considerable attention because of their interaction with the dopaminergic system and as potential targets for Parkinson's disease pharmacotherapy. 
Post mortem adenosine A2A receptor mRNA and [3H]SCH 58261- specific binding to adenosine A2A receptor were studied in the brain of Parkinson's disease patients using in situ hybridization and receptor binding autoradiography, respectively. 
Fourteen levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease patients, of which seven developed dyskinesias and seven did not, were compared with nine controls. 
Nigrostriatal denervation was similar between dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic Parkinson's disease patients, as assessed with catecholamine concentrations and [125I]RTI-121-specific binding to dopamine transporters. 
The increase of adenosine A2A receptor mRNA in dyskinetic Parkinson's disease patients was also significant compared with non-dyskinetic Parkinson's disease patients (+60%; P < 0.05) in the lateral putamen. 
Moreover, [3H]SCH 58261-specific binding to adenosine A2A receptors was increased in the external globus pallidus (+24%; P < 0.001) of Parkinson's disease patients compared with controls, regardless of the dyskinesigenic response to levodopa. 
These findings suggest that increased synthesis of adenosine A2A receptors in striatopallidal pathway neurons is associated with the development of dyskinesias following long-term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
Lymphocytes of patients with Parkinson's disease may show reduced DA content and impaired DA transporter immunoreactivity. 
 In this study, we measured the lymphocyte levels of proteins involved in apoptosis regulation, such as Bcl-2, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), caspase-3, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), either untreated or under therapy with dopaminergic agents (l-Dopa alone or l-dopa + dopamine agonists) and in healthy volunteers.

 BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used as a treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and Parkinson's disease (PD).

This is particularly relevant to the timing of levodopa in Parkinson's disease, as missed treatment can be detrimental. 
Regional anaesthesia may, however, have significant advantages in patients with Parkinson's disease, who can continue to take oral levodopa preoperatively, during surgery, if required, and early in the postoperative period. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious motor disorder and it is the second most common brain degenerative disease in human.

 In Parkinson's disease (PD), conformational changes in the alpha-synuclein monomer precede the formation of Lewy bodies. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder arising from loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and subsequent depletion of striatal dopamine levels, which results in distressing motor symptoms. 
Development of improved therapeutics for such disorders as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia would be significantly enhanced with the availability of the 3D structure for the dopamine receptors and of the binding site for dopamine and other agonists and antagonists. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by a continuous and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta with a subsequent reduction of the neurotransmitter dopamine. 
Quetiapine is first line for a patient with Parkinson's disease.

Positron emission tomography studies have recently shown that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease, pain, and depression is related to the activation of the limbic circuitry. 
The observation that placebo administration induces the release of dopamine in the ventral striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease suggests a link between the placebo effect and reward mechanisms. 
In addition to Parkinson's disease, the placebo-reward model may also apply to other disorders. 
Thus, while the placebo-induced clinical benefit observed in Parkinson's disease would mostly reflect the release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum, the activation of opioid and serotonin pathways could be particularly implicated in mediating placebo responses encountered in pain and depression, respectively. 
In this respect, Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family with proapoptotic and inflammatory functions, was reported to be elevated within the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

 We have identified a new mutant mouse that we have named new mouse neurological mutant 3 (NM3); it may be a useful model to understand the underlying molecular and genetic basis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Human neural stem cells (hNSCs) are excellent candidates to serve this role, but, for the case of Parkinson's disease, the cells do not normally express the rate-limiting dopamine (DA) synthesis enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and are not equipped with the detoxifying mechanisms needed to prevent the neurotoxicity associated with the DA phenotype. 
These results may be relevant for the generation of TH/DA-producing human neural cells for in vitro and neurotransplantation research in Parkinson's disease.

Because intermittent exposure to low doses of amphetamine and other stimulants has been shown to enhance responsiveness to subsequent stimulant exposure, our findings suggest that sensitization of D1 signaling may provide a novel neurobiological mechanism for improving a core cognitive process in conditions in which dopamine function has deteriorated, such as in normal aging and Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease is often complicated by the occurrence of motor fluctuations, which can be predictable ('wearing-off') or unpredictable ('on-off'). 
The pathogenesis of motor fluctuations in treated Parkinson's disease and diurnal fluctuation in untreated DRD is poorly understood. 
Changes in two parameters, (i) the proportion of vesicles that undergo exocytosis per unit of time and (ii) the proportion of dopamine subject to re-uptake from the synapse, allowed us to model different curves of levodopa response, for the same degree of nigrostriatal damage in Parkinson's disease. 
Additionally, we calculated the probability of obtaining a second ON period after a single dose of levodopa in Parkinson's disease (the 'yo-yoing' phenomenon). 
The model supports the idea that presynaptic mechanisms play a key role in both short-duration and long-duration responses encountered in Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine receptors agonists and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are the novel classes of the drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment in both early and late stages.

These findings, together with the known ability of CDK5 inhibitors to prevent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, suggest that this class of compounds could potentially be used as a novel treatment for disorders associated with dopamine deficiency, such as Parkinson's disease. 
The role of long-term exposure to food-related beta-carbolines and a retention of these compounds in pigment-containing neurons in the induction of idiopathic Parkinson's disease should be further considered.

Here we report the presence of 125I-alpha-conotoxinMII and alpha-conotoxinMII-sensitive 125I-epibatidine nicotinic receptors in human control and Parkinson's disease striatum. 
In Parkinson's disease caudate, there was a approximately 50% decline in 125I-alpha-conotoxinMII sites with a similar decline in the dopamine transporter. 
Correlation analyses between changes in nicotinic receptors and the dopamine transporter in Parkinson's disease striatum suggest that alpha-conotoxinMII-sensitive 125I-epibatidine sites (low-affinity sites), 125I-A85380 and 125I-epibatidine sites are localized in part to dopaminergic terminals. 
In summary, these results show that alpha-conotoxinMII-sensitive sites are present in human striatum and that there are high- and low-affinity subtypes which are both decreased in Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia are both associated with changes in mRNA and peptide levels of the opioid peptide precursors preproenkephalin-A (PPE-A) and preproenkephalin-B (PPE-B). 
Furthermore, a potential role of abnormal opioid peptide transmission in dyskinesia is suggested due to the ability of opioid receptor antagonists to reduce the L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, the behavioural response, striatal topography and levels of expression of the opioid peptide precursors PPE-A and PPE-B were assessed, following repeated vehicle, ropinirole, or L-DOPA administration in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
vehicle, 6-OHDA-lesioned caudal striatum) in the unilaterally 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease, ropinirole did not. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) as the most important movement disorder is characterized by a progressive loss of nigral dopamine neurons and a subsequent degeneration within several other transmitter systems. 
 Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The most prominent neurochemical hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA). 
GDNF is known to protect dopaminergic neurons in animal and cellular models of Parkinson's disease, and the supplement has been tried for the treatment of degenerating dopamine neurons in Parkinsonian patients. 
Instead, they become a dominant feature of neural activity in the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and in parkinsonian states induced by dopamine depletion in experimental animals. 
 The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride can produce a range of cognitive deficits in normal volunteers, consistent with those seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The latter can have implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Friedreich ataxia, aceruloplasminemia, Hallervorden Spatz syndrome) where abnormal iron accumulation in the brain is thought to be associated with the degenerative processes. 
 Dopamine (DA) neurons degenerate in Parkinson's disease and dopamine neurotransmission may be affected in psychotic states seen in schizophrenia. 
A marked reduction of ALDH1 expression was seen in surviving neurons of SN pars compacta but not of those in the VTA in Parkinson's disease. 
 Glutamate receptors were studied in the brains of controls and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, of which 10 of 14 developed motor complications (dyskinesias and/or wearing-off) following levodopa therapy. 
The resulting functional imbalance is thought to be responsible for the bradykinesia of Parkinson's disease, which may be temporarily normalized by dopamine replacement therapy. 
This switch in D1-receptor-mediated regulation of protein kinase systems responsible for neuronal plasticity is suggested to underlie dyskinesia produced by L-DOPA treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The loss of central dopamine, which characterises Parkinson's disease, led to the main pharmacological strategy for treatment, namely levodopa, a dopamine-replacement therapy. 
There is a resurgence of interest in neurosurgery for treating the Parkinson's disease, particularly in new techniques targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which is overactive in Parkinson's disease and contributes to symptom development. 
We also provide details of a case with Parkinson's disease who underwent high-frequency bilateral stimulation of the STN and in whom we analysed the STN post-mortem. 
Although unilateral subthalamotomy improves some aspects of parkinsonism, it causes postural abnormalities in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
Because bilateral high-frequency STN stimulation improves disease symptoms, is reversible and is not reported to induce postural side-effects, it may be a better surgical therapy for Parkinson's disease than lesioning the STN. 
DLB shares many features with Parkinson's disease (PD) with respect to LB distribution in the brainstem, and there is recent evidence that Lewy pathology (LP), which consists of LBs and LNs, may progress in a systematic fashion through the brain regardless of clinical phenotype. 
 BACKGROUND: Oral dopamine agonists are effective for treating early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This modulation is thought to be relevant to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
The present study demonstrates that acute rTMS treatment of the frontal brain affects the DAergic neuronal system in the rat dorsolateral striatum, and may have therapeutic implications for Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent recognition of daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease (PD) has prompted a search for its causes. 
Inclusions found in nigral neurones stained for alpha-synuclein, a proteic hallmark of Lewy bodies that are frequently observed in Parkinson's disease and other degenerative disorders. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neurons that innervate the striatum. 
The production of peroxide due to dopamine metabolism is also observed after rats receive a dose of L-DOPA, a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent observations from clinical trials of neural grafting for Parkinson's disease (PD) have demonstrated that grafted dopamine neurons can worsen dyskinesias in some graft recipients. 
 Levodopa continues to be the most effective agent for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
DAT imaging is abnormal in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy and does not distinguish between these disorders. 
Additional applications are characterising dementia with parkinsonian features (abnormal results in dementia with Lewy bodies, normal in Alzheimer's disease); and differentiating juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (abnormal DAT) from dopa-responsive dystonia (normal DAT). 
 Levodopa pharmacokinetic-phamacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling may be able to test the functional integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Levodopa t1/2(eq) was highly significantly correlated with H&Y scale (r = -0.815, p < 0.0001), Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (r = -0.691, p < 0.0001) and PD symptom duration (r = -0.647, p < 0.0001). 
 In Parkinson's disease the neurones of the subthalamic nucleus show increased synchrony and oscillatory burst discharge, thought to reflect a breakdown of parallel processing in basal ganglia circuitry. 
Prevention of context-dependent intensification of catalepsy could be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Switching from one dopamine agonist to another is common practice in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Mitochondrial complex I activity is partially suppressed in patients with Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal death. 
 OBJECTIVE: To identify a haplotype influencing onset age for Parkinson's disease (PD) in the PARK3 region on chromosome 2p13. 
 Research and development of the adenosine A2A receptor selective antagonist KW6002 have focused on developing a novel nondopaminergic therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The A2A receptor has recently attracted considerable interest as a potential target for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy based on the motor-enhancing and neuroprotective effects of A2A antagonists in animal models of PD. 
 The principal therapeutic agents used in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) enhance nigrostriatal dopaminergic flux through either replenishment of depleted dopamine stores or the action of dopaminergic agonists. 
 The selective localization of adenosine A2A receptors to the striatopallidal system suggested a new therapeutic approach to the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease, blockade of A2A receptors facilitates L-dopa-induced turning behavior by antagonism of A2A transmission, which is increased after dopamine depletion. 
 The future management of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires pharmacologic agents that do not lose efficacy with disease progression or induce dyskinesia and that are free of other dopaminergic side effects. 
A2A antagonists acutely enhance motor behavior in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and are therefore considered potential PD therapeutic agents. 
Therefore, possible D2/A2A/mGluR5 multimeric receptor complexes and the receptor interactions within them may have a major role in controlling the dorsal and ventral striatopallidal GABA neurons involved in Parkinson's disease and in schizophrenia and drug addiction, respectively. 
Stimulation of A(2A)Rs on GP terminals may facilitate GABAergic signaling and contribute to the overactivation observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Development of selective antagonists and knockout mice have highlighted the potential usefulness of A2A antagonists in decreasing symptoms and progression of Parkinson's disease-something that has also been vindicated by careful epidemiologic studies. 
The relative roles of various members of the human sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme family in the metabolism of apomorphine, a dopamine receptor antagonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, more recently, erectile dysfunction, were examined. 
 Four dopamine receptor agonists used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (apomorphine, pergolide, ropinirole and sumanirole) were evaluated for the ability to block human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) channels and to modify the duration of canine Purkinje fiber action potentials. 
Taken together, these data provide evidence that dopamine receptor agonists developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease differentially influence hERG K(+) channel function and cardiac action potential duration. 
 R-(-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane [(-)-BPAP] is a catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer that increases impulse-evoked catecholamine and serotonin release from nerve terminals, and is a candidate for symptomatic treatment of early Parkinson's disease. 
Using nationwide computerized registers of death data for the years 1991 through 1996 we examined 12,430,473 deaths of persons over 40 years of age and extracted 144,364 cases with Parkinson's disease (PD), a dopamine deficient population. 
 We investigated, in mice, the influence of life experience on the vulnerability to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a major neurotoxin that induces a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in humans, and to cocaine, a potent psychostimulant that promotes drug addiction. 
Furthermore, they suggest that the probability of developing neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or vulnerability to psychostimulants may be related to life experience. 
Our results also suggest that the STN may be an important target for levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVES: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently suffer from cardiovascular dysfunction, which may be enhanced to various extents by different antiparkinsonian drugs. 
The use of low-dose clozapine is supported by RCTs in Parkinson's disease. 
 Psychosis in elderly patients is a growing clinical concern because psychotic symptoms most frequently occur as noncognitive manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, as side effects of drug therapy for Parkinson's disease, or as the primary abnormalities in schizophrenia, and the clinical characteristics of psychosis are distinct for each. 
Traditional antipsychotic agents bind to dopamine receptors and effectively relieve positive schizophrenic symptoms but frequently cause tardive dyskinesia and other extrapyramidal symptoms, a problem for elderly patients, particularly for those with Parkinson's disease. 
 Chronic exposure to manganese may induce parkinsonism similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dyskinesia frequently mars the long-term therapeutic response to levodopa (LD) in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 There is evidence that both inflammatory mechanisms and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. 
 Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to improve cognition and treat psychosis and other behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. 
 Mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to dopaminergic (DAergic) cell death in Parkinson's disease and GABAergic cell death in Huntington's disease. 
Tetrahydropapaveroline [THP; 6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3',4'-dihydroxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline], a dopamine-derived tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid, has been reported to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and is considered to contribute to neurodegeneration implicated in Parkinson's disease. 
 We previously showed that S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) induces movement impairments similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) apparently by prenylated protein methylation; 5 kDa molecules being methylated and the symptoms being inhibited by prenylcysteine (PC) analogs. 
While these findings suggest usefulness of non-narcotic analgesics in neuroprotective therapy in neurodegenerative diseases, aspirin appears to be a potential candidate in prophylactic as well as in adjuvant therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs). 
However, the clinical features of Parkinson's disease, a dopamine deficiency disorder of the brain, do not appear to be characteristic of human methamphetamine users. 
We compared dopamine levels in autopsied brain tissue of chronic methamphetamine users with those in patients with Parkinson's disease and in a control group. 
Mean dopamine levels in the methamphetamine users were reduced more in the caudate (-61%) than in the putamen (-50%), a pattern opposite to that of Parkinson's disease. 
 Long-term dopamine replacement therapy of Parkinson's disease leads to the occurrence of dyskinesias. 
Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic drug that counteracts neuronal (hyper)synchronization in animal models of epilepsy, was assessed in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease, after coadministration with (1) levodopa (L-dopa) or (2) ropinirole/L-dopa combination. 
 Recent imaging studies suggest a rapid degeneration of the dopaminergic system in early Parkinson's disease (PD), followed by a slowing of the degenerative process in advanced disease. 
 Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown potential as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors expressing the GDNF protein (rAAV-GDNF) have been used in rodent models of Parkinson's disease to promote functional regeneration after 6-OHDA lesions of the nigrostriatal system. 
Therefore, our study provides evidence for the behavioural and anatomical efficacy of GDNF delivered via an rAAV vector as a possible treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 Many dopamine agonists used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are suggested to be potentially neuroprotective. 
These results suggest that lisuride can protect neurons against iron-induced cell death and might thus be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease. 
Since they produce dopamine, these cells have been proposed for the treatment of neuronal deficits in human Parkinson's disease. 
To evaluate the contribution of adenosinergic mechanisms to the pathogenesis of the response alterations induced by dopaminergic treatment, we studied the ability of the selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist KW-6002 to prevent as well as palliate these syndromes in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease. 
Our findings strengthen the rationale for developing A(2A) antagonists as an early treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease. 
stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, and in each disorder the pathophysiology of OAB can be multifactorial. 
Emerging evidence indicates that an inflammatory process is involved in dopaminergic nigro-striatal neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of the first study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of Zydis Selegiline (1.25 mg or 10 mg) with conventional selegiline hydrochloride tablets "conventional selegiline tablets" (10 mg) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were previously treated with conventional selegiline tablets as an adjunct to levodopa/dopamine agonist therapy. 
 Recent findings suggest that oxidative stress caused by dopamine could be closely involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The serotonergic and dopaminergic inputs to the corpus striatum in human and non-human primates participate in diverse sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective functions, are implicated in dysfunction in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, and are targets for many of the drugs used to treat these disorders. 
Further, the predominantly stimulatory effects observed occurred in striatal areas analogous to those suspected as sites of localized dopamine and/or serotonin compromise in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 The mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) system is involved in many brain functions including motor control and motivated behaviour, and is of clinical importance because of its implication in psychiatric disorders and Parkinson's disease. 
 The presence of neuronal elements that are indicative of dopaminergic neurotransmission in cerebellum suggest that this brain region may contribute to the motor symptoms or dyskinesia seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine the expression of markers for dopaminergic neurotransmission in the cerebellum from postmortem brain tissue obtained from normal subjects and patients dying with Parkinson's disease who were receiving treatment with dopaminergic drugs. 
In Parkinson's disease, the level of dopamine D1 and D3 receptor mRNA was significantly reduced in lobule 9 and the level of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA was significantly reduced in lobule 10. 
No alteration in the level of dopamine D2 receptor or dopamine transporter mRNA was found in either lobule in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The discrete changes in the levels of dopamine D1 and D3 receptors and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in cerebellum from l-DOPA treated Parkinson's disease patients suggests that this brain area has a role in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and/or the beneficial/side-effects of treatment. 
Understanding the mechanism of rotenone-induced apoptosis in dopamine neurons may contribute to the development of new neuroprotective strategies against Parkinson's disease. 
 Symptoms of Parkinson's disease do not present until the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is nearly complete.

 Dystonias are frequently observed in Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes. 
As described in this review, these studies not only provide insight into the pharmacological actions of stimulants, but also mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. 
Neurological investigations revealed Parkinson's disease as the cause of the tremor. 
Upon adequate treatment of Parkinson's disease, the tremor artefact immediately disappears from the ECG. 
In animal models of Parkinson's disease this nucleus may be dysfunctional and neurons may fire in oscillatory patterns that can be closely related to tremor. 
Both STN lesions and high frequency stimulation ameliorate the major motor symptoms of parkinsonism in humans and animal models of Parkinson's disease and reverse certain electrophysiological and metabolic consequences of dopamine depletion. 
The aim of the present article is to review briefly the major anatomical, pharmacological and physiological aspects of the STN, as well as its involvement in the pathophysiology and treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The dihydroxylated tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, 2(N)-methyl-norsalsolinol (NMNorsal), was identified in L-DOPA-treated patients with Parkinson's disease and proposed to be responsible for behavioral changes. 
Since the occurrence of hallucinosis or psychosis following L-DOPA treatment is related to the serotonergic system, these results probably reflect a link between NMNorsal and L-DOPA side effects in Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the non-ergot dopamine agonist pramipexole in untreated and levodopa-treated Chinese patients with early or advanced Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: Pramipexole is an effective and well-tolerated therapy, with or without concomitant levodopa, for Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Psychiatric abnormalities have been described in primary neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, primary generalized epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), central nervous system glioma, and syndrome X with vascular dementia. 
The significance of these changes in the pathogenesis of syndrome X, multiple sclerosis, primary generalized epilepsy, schizophrenia, SSPE, and Parkinson's disease is discussed in the setting of the interrelationship between these disorders documented in literature. 
 High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is thought to be superior to stimulation of the internal pallidum (GPi) in alleviating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
An imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant has been postulated to lead the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
A primary target for neurorestoration is Parkinson's disease, characterized by a continuous loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to dopamine depletion in the striatum and subsequent clinical symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. 
Therefore, these neural progenitor cells might serve as a useful source of dopaminergic neurons for studying the development and degeneration of these cells and may further serve as a continuous, on-demand source of cells for therapeutic transplantation in Parkinson's disease. 
In the present investigation an attempt has been made to validate the role of GDNF co-transplantation with fetal ventral mesencephalic cells (VMC) on functional viability and restoration using neurobehavioral, neurochemical and immunohistochemical parameters at 6 weeks post-transplantation in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Results suggest that co-transplantation of VMC and GDNF may be a better approach towards functional restoration in 6-OHDA lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Enhanced oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease, characteristic pathological features are the cell death of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and the formation of Lewy bodies composed of oxidized proteins. 
This mechanism might account for the accumulation of modified protein and, at least partially, for cell death of the dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
At the onset of PSP the initial diagnosis was almost always Parkinson's disease. 
 Excessive daytime somnolence is a common adverse effect of dopamine-agonist treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We used SPECT and the tracer (123)I-Ioflupane to measure dopamine transporter (DAT) binding in the caudate nucleus and the putamen of 70 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 10 with multiple system atrophy (MSA-P type), and 10 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder that afflicts >1 million people in North America. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disorder with many different causes, yet they may intersect in common pathways, raising the possibility that neuroprotective agents may have broad applicability in the treatment of PD. 
Patients younger than 30 years and those with neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, multiples sclerosis and dementia were excluded, as well as those with schizophrenia or other illusional disturbances, eating disorders, histories of opioid or codeine-containing analgesic abuse or of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. 
 OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), taking dopamine agonists (DAs) and reporting unintended sleep episodes (SEs), exhibit physiologically defined daytime sleepiness and can thus be differentiated from those taking DAs but not reporting SEs. 
Dopamine agonists are effective as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa in the advanced stages of the disease. 
Dopamine agonists are increasingly used early, particularly in young-onset Parkinson's disease due to their levodopa-sparing effects and putative role as neuroprotective agents. 
This review summarizes the use of dopamine agonists in Parkinson's disease and reviews the laboratory, clinical and functional imaging evidence of neuroprotection in this class of drug and discusses the clinical implications of their use in Parkinson's disease management. 
OBJECTIVE: To determine in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]-Raclopride, whether STN stimulation induces a striatal DA release.

The authors recommend it for the treatment of outpatients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Neurophysiological studies of the brain in normal and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have indicated intricate connections for basal ganglia-induced control of signaling into the motor cortex. 
These experimental results obtained in primate studies of striato-thalamo-cortico circuitry show a similar trend as hypothetized in Parkinson's disease-type degeneration. 
 Deficient perception and cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been attributed to slow information processing, but an alternative explanation may be reduced signal strength. 
The results of this study suggest that the behavioral synergy induced by local co-stimulation of D1 and 5-HT2 receptors within the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum may lead to hyperkinesias that can occur with continued pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In conclusion, atipamezole improved the efficacy of L-DOPA and apomorphine in an animal model of Parkinson's disease and also reduced adverse dopaminergic effects on vigilance and on cardiovascular function. 
These results suggest that an investigation of the effects of specific alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists in Parkinson's disease patients is warranted. 
 Exogenous GDNF as well as vectors containing the gene for this trophic factor has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a highly selective loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) greater than in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). 
Involvement of these adrenergic receptor mechanisms may be exploited in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Epidemiological studies have linked insecticide exposure and Parkinson's disease. 
These data provide further evidence that insecticides can affect the primary neurodegenerative substrate of Parkinson's disease. 
These results have provided a new understanding into the mechanism of neuroprotective actions of rasagiline and its anti-Alzheimer drug derivatives TV3326 and TV3279, which are relevant for therapy of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. 
 Animal studies investigating the efficacy of neurotrophic factors as treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) ideally require partial dopamine (DA) lesion models. 
 The essential metal iron has long been implicated in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease. 
 Alpha-synuclein and its missense mutants (A30P, A53T) have been linked to the genesis of idiopathic and rare familial forms of Parkinson's disease, respectively. 
Although the complex formation with hDAT occurs through the NAC domain of the alpha-synuclein variants, it is the familial Parkinson's disease-linked missense mutations present in the amino-terminal lipid binding domain of the alpha-synuclein variants that dictate the extent of the regulation of hDAT function. 
 Lewy bodies in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contain aggregates of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). 
Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects were randomly assigned to carbidopa/levodopa or placebo for Visit 1 or 2 and participated in the following two studies: (1) Finger tapping. 
We concluded that (1) levodopa improves physical fatigue in finger tapping and force generation, (2) physical fatigue in Parkinson's disease is at least partially related to dopamine deficiency, and (3) the MFI measures different aspects of physical fatigue compared with those measured by finger tapping and force generation. 
 Ecstasy [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)] was shown to prolong the action of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) while suppressing dyskinesia in a single patient with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 OBJECTIVE: The mixed dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist pramipexole is effective as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as adjunctive therapy in advanced disease. 
Clinical trials suggest that the benefits of pramipexole may extend beyond the relief of motor symptoms (akinesia, rigidity and tremor at rest) to amelioration of depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of this study was to confirm the beneficial effects of pramipexole on the core symptoms of Parkinson's disease (with a focus on tremor), as well as to assess its antidepressant activity, during routine clinical practice. 
PATIENTS: Data for 657 outpatients with Parkinson's disease were collected from German hospitals and specialist practices. 
CONCLUSION: In addition to ameliorating the core symptoms of akinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease, pramipexole improves tremor and depressive symptoms in routine clinical practice. 
 We review the basic science of the dopamine transporter (DAT), a key neurotransmitter for locomotor control and reward systems, including those lost or deranged in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
There is sufficient doubt surrounding the sensitivity, reproducibility, and confounding effects in this study that these data should not be used to formulate a decision on de novo therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 As a diagnostic test for patients with suspected Parkinson's disease (PD), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using [(123)I]FP-CIT tracer has better sensitivity but is more expensive than regular clinical examination (CE). 
 During the past decade, dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging with single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) has evolved as an objective in vivo marker of nigrostriatal neuron loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Previously, there were a few other tracers suggested to be useful in the study of in vivo brain biochemistry in humans, particularly in patients afflicted with Parkinson's disease (PD) or parkinsonian syndromes. 
In atypical tremor disorders, DAT imaging can differentiate between Parkinson's disease (PD), where dopamine deficit is demonstrated on DAT imaging, and essential tremor, where no dopamine deficit is found. 
Although clinical criteria enable accurate and reliable diagnosis of fully developed Parkinson's disease, there are several areas of diagnostic uncertainty relating to atypical parkinsonian disorders, isolated tremor symptoms not fulfilling essential tremor criteria, as well as drug-induced and psychogenetic parkinsonism. 
We herein show that sonic hedgehog signaling molecules are differentially regulated by dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia of adult animals and specifically that sonic hedgehog levels are reduced in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
As the subthalamic nucleus is overactive in parkinsonism, we suggest that enhancement of sonic hedgehog signaling in the subthalamic nucleus may be of therapeutic value in Parkinson's disease. 
This survey summarizes current knowledge on the molecular and pharmacological characterization of DA receptors, their role in the regulation of various processes in an organism, and involvement in the therapy of several disorders, in particular in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and hypertension. 
 The aim of this study was to compare dopamine receptor binding affinities of all currently approved dopamine receptor agonist treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) in human brain tissue. 
 Mutation of genes encoding for various components of a metabolic pathway named the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UP) leads to inherited forms of Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas various components of the UP are constantly present within neuronal inclusions, Lewy bodies, that characterize most genetic and sporadic forms of PD. 
 Dopamine is a critical modulator of striatal function; its absence produces Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects an estimated 1 million people in the US and tens of millions worldwide. 
 The dopamine 3 (D3) subtype receptor has been implicated in several neurological conditions, and potent and selective D3 ligands may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug addiction, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. 
Whether or not VM and striatum cografting could ameliorate motor dysfunction in a Parkinson's disease (PD) patient was explored in this study. 
We investigated whether minocycline would protect against toxic effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a toxin that selectively destroys nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DA) neurons and produces a clinical state similar to Parkinson's disease (PD) in rodents and primates.

 The majority of Parkinson's disease patients undergoing levodopa therapy develop disabling motor complications (dyskinesias) within 10 years of treatment. 
Although levodopa is known to cause changes in CB1 receptor expression in animal models of Parkinson's disease, we have no information on whether this drug alters the brain concentrations of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol. 
 Although it is well known that high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) alleviates the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.

Parkinson's disease is a cause of primary autonomic failure with involvement of the peripheral nervous system. 
These histological and pharmacological characteristics clearly differentiate autonomic failure of Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager's syndrome). 
If autonomic abnormalities appear to be present since the early stages of the disease, the early onset, within the first year, of symptomatic OH in the course of a parkinsonian syndrome can be considered as an exclusion criterion for idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
REGARDING TREATMENT: No specific clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of antihypotensive drugs in the treatment of OH in Parkinson's disease. 
The novel class of N-propargylamine nitroxyls, JSAKs, may have potential implications for the experimental therapies of Parkinson's disease, where ROS mediate deleterious effects, because these compounds have an ability to either block or reduce the progression of neurotoxic cascade of brain damage. 
 Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons and appearance of Lewy bodies, cytoplasmic inclusions that are highly enriched with ubiquitin.

Recently, a mutation in the synphilin-1 gene has been reported in patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease. 
In connection with the previously documented acute regulation of RGS proteins after modulation of the dopaminergic transmission [Geurts et al., Neurosci Lett 2002;333:146-50], the present study demonstrates that alteration in their genetic expression can be long-lasting and this could reflect the adaptation processes that occur in certain pathological states, such as Parkinson's disease.

 Iometopane [(123)I beta-CIT, GPI 200, RTI 55], a tropane derivative labelled with iodine-123, is a dopamine imaging agent that was under development with Guilford Pharmaceuticals (as Dopascan Injection) for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
Neurochemical imaging with iometopane using conventional single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) provided images of the brain for the distinguished diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
The ability of iometopane to bind to the dopamine transporter on presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminal in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) has been used to differentiate the uptake of the agent by the neurons in the striatum in patients with a Parkinsonian disorder (Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy) from patients without a Parkinsonian disorder (essential tremor and healthy controls) with high sensitivity and specificity. 
The rate of clinical progression of Parkinson's disease varies greatly and is currently unpredictable. 
Diagnostic imaging with Dopascan Injection is thought to differentiate Parkinson's disease from other forms of tremor, eliminate tests such as MRI and CT scans, unnecessary and inappropriate medications (psychotropics), and significantly reduce the number of people remaining on Parkinson's disease medications for life, despite not having Parkinson's disease. 
MAP Medical Technologies (Schering AG) submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in Finland for European approval of iometopane for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in April 2002.

 On the basis of experimental studies which have demonstrated deleterious effects of L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) in vivo and in vitro, it has been suggested that L-DOPA itself may contribute to the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 The development of animal models of Parkinson's disease is of great importance in order to test substitutive or neuroprotective strategies for Parkinson's disease.

 Current symptomatic treatments for Parkinson's disease are based largely on dopamine replacement therapies; however, the fact that these treatments are characterized by many long-term side effects has led to widespread interest in nondopaminergic therapies. 
Here the authors discuss recent findings that systemic administration of a selective delta-opioid receptor agonist has powerful antiparkinsonian effects in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease that are equivalent to those of dopamine replacement. 
delta-Opioid receptor agonists may prove to be useful for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease in humans.

 Pramipexole is a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
This phenomenon may be physiologically significant in the control of motor function, as well as in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease. 
Because the dopamine precursor l-DOPA is the most commonly used therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease, we investigated the effects of l-DOPA treatment on striatal nAChR expression in unlesioned and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned monkeys. 
These declines in nAChRs with l-DOPA may be relevant to both the therapeutic and side effect profiles of l-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
1) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients without (Gr. 
 18F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) has been used for two decades to study the organization and pathology of the striatal dopamine system in the human brain, particularly in Parkinson's disease.

 The symptoms of Parkinson's disease can become increasingly difficult to control as the disease advances, particularly with the development of motor complications, such as end-of-dose wearing-off and dyskinesias, following long-term therapy. 
At this stage, the patient is frequently referred to a Parkinson's disease specialist for advice on the management of their disease. 
In this review we provide an overview of the Parkinson's disease specialist's strategies for coping with such problems.

This work may provide a rodent model for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease, and be suitable for further investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS. 
 While advancing age is the only unequivocally accepted risk factor for idiopathic Parkinson's disease, it has been postulated that exposure to environmental neurotoxicants combined with ageing could increase the risk for developing Parkinson's disease. 
The current study tested this hypothesis by exposing C57BL/6 mice that were 6 weeks, 5 months or 18 months old to the herbicide paraquat, the fungicide maneb or paraquat + maneb, a combination that produces a Parkinson's disease phenotype in young adult mice.

The neuronal damage induced by METH may reflect neurological disorders such as autism and Parkinson's disease. 
 Since mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, we determined the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function in the substantia nigra of mice treated with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) using a cDNA array. 
The potential significance of these gene alterations in the context of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 We compared the striatal uptake of [(18)F]fluorodopa with [(76)Br]-FE-CBT, a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which estimates the density of dopamine nerve terminals, in 6 patients with Parkinson's disease grafted with fetal mesencephalic cells. 
 The biosynthesis, structure and function of neuromelanin (NM), the dark brown melanin-like pigment present in the substantia nigra (SN), are not well characterized, in spite of the possible involvement of NM in the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by fibrillary neuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs) consisting largely of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), the protein mutated in some patients with familial PD. 
 We studied the effectiveness of cabergoline as an adjunct in patients with early Parkinson's disease receiving another dopamine agonist (pramipexole or ropinirole), at the maximal permitted dose. 
This open study shows that dual dopamine agonist therapy can be useful in the symptomatic treatment of patients with early or more advanced Parkinson's disease receiving therapy with or without levodopa. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. 
We examined 12 families with familial Parkinson's disease ascertained at the Movement Disorder clinic at the Oregon Health Sciences University for genetic linkage to a number of candidate loci. 
These loci have been implicated in familial Parkinson's disease or in syndromes with a clinical presentation that overlaps with parkinsonism, as well as potentially in the pathogenesis of the disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
 Presymptomatic diagnosis of the loss of nigrostriatal neurons that characterises Parkinson's disease, is a crucial issue for future neuroprotective therapies as degeneration exceeds 70 to 80% when symptoms appear. 
The NO-induced dopaminergic cell loss causing Parkinson's disease (PD) has been postulated to include the following: an inhibition of cytochrome oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase, mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV in the respiratory chain, superoxide dismutase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; activation or initiation of DNA strand breakage, poly(ADP-ribose) synthase, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation; release of iron; and increased generation of toxic radicals such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra zona compacta, and in other subcortical nuclei associated with a widespread occurrence of Lewy bodies. 
The causes of cell death in Parkinson's disease are still poorly understood, but a defect in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced oxidative stress have been proposed. 
We have examined 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1)-induced apoptosis in control and metallothionein-overexpressing dopaminergic neurons, with a primary objective to determine the neuroprotective potential of metallothionein against peroxynitrite-induced neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
These studies provide evidence that nitric oxide synthase activation and peroxynitrite ion overproduction may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, and that metallothionein gene induction may provide neuroprotection. 
 In Parkinson's disease, neuroprotective therapy to rescue dopamine neurons has been proposed. 
These results suggested that ginsenoside Rg1 may attenuate dopamine-induced apoptotic cell death through suppression of intracellular oxidative stress, and that it may rescue or protect dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 The dopamine transporter (DAT), located presynaptically on dopamine neurons, provides a marker for Parkinson's disease (Pd) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Although clinical evidence is still limited, the circumstantial data from several recent studies suggest that green tea polyphenols may promote health and reduce disease occurrence, and possibly protect against Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. 
All of these biological effects may benefit patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 In spite of the extensive studies performed on postmortem substantia nigra from Parkinson's disease patients, the aetiology of the disease has not yet been established. 
To a large extent, the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) animal models of Parkinson's disease confirm these findings. 
One reason for this may be related to the fact that in normal human brains the number of dopaminergic neurons falls by around 3-5% every decade, while in Parkinson's disease this decline is greater. 
First, the animal models of Parkinson's disease may not be totally reflective of the disease and, therefore, the chemical pathologies established in the animal models may not cause, or contribute to, the progression of the disease clinically. 
The latter concept receives support from recent complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray gene expression studies, which show the existence of a gene cascade of events occurring in the nigrostriatal pathway of MPTP, 6-OHDA and methamphetamine animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium, PQ) is a herbicide to possibly induce Parkinson's disease (PD), since a strong correlation has been found between the incidence of the disease and the amount of PQ used. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cognitive deficits that occur even early in the course of Parkinson's disease have received increasing attention in current imaging research. 
RECENT FINDINGS: Abnormal networks identified in studies of resting state metabolism in Parkinson's disease represent metabolic markers for remote effects of striato-nigral degeneration. 
Additionally, more research is needed into the role of non-dopaminergic pathology in cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease. 
As an example, adenosine, dopamine, and glutamate metabotropic receptor/receptor interactions in the striatopallidal GABA neurons are discussed as well as their relevance for Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug dependence. 
 The diverse damaging effects of dopamine (DA) oxidation products on brain subcellular components including mitochondrial electron transport chain have been implicated in dopaminergic neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. 
The inactivation of neuronal Na+, K+-ATPase by DA may give rise to various toxic sequelae with potential implications for dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
 Free cytoplasmic dopamine may be involved in the genesis of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease and other such diseases. 
 Although it is generally accepted that free radicals are involved in the neurodegenerative process occurring in the dopaminergic neurons of the nigro-striatal system in Parkinson's disease, the exact mechanism of neurodegeneration in vivo is still unknown. 
 The cause of chronic nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. 
 To investigate the effect of the dopamine D2 and D1 receptor agonist cabergoline on sleep, periodic leg movements (PLMs) in sleep, and early morning motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The present study explored whether implantation of HAE cells can be a possible means to deliver trophic factors into the brain to prevent the death of DA neurons in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Although the factors that contribute to the currently observed effects remain to be fully determined, implantation of HAE cells could be a viable strategy to counteract the loss of DA neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
Under these conditions, small fluctuations in firing rate are not compensated for in time, which could be one of the factors responsible for the motor fluctuations often observed in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
 Our group investigated modulatory effects of apomorphine on cerebral activation patterns during finger tapping movements in seven Parkinson's disease (PD) patients off medication. 
This study assessed the changes in the isoprenoid pathway and the consequences of its dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
A dysfunctional isoprenoid pathway and related cascade are important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
A hypothalamic digoxin mediated model for Parkinson's disease is also postulated. 
 Significant evidence has been provided to support the hypothesis that oxidant stress may be responsible for degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa is the major drug used in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
However, levodopa continues to be 'contra-indicated' for patients with Parkinson's disease associated with malignant melanoma. 
Clinical characteristics of 54 patients with both Parkinson's disease and melanoma were analyzed (43 cases from the literature and 11 from our institution). 
The results suggest that the occurrence of both Parkinson's disease and melanoma in these patients is coincidental rather than causal. 
It did not appear that the Parkinson's disease patients on levodopa therapy were predisposed to melanoma, nor did levodopa therapy appear to exaggerate melanoma if it were previously present. 
 There is now evidence for definite and early cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD), involving, in particular, executive functions and working memory. 
 In the current study we investigated the role of dopamine in attentional and socio-emotional functioning by examining effects of withdrawing dopaminergic medication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The glial reaction is generally considered to be a consequence of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease, postmortem examination reveals a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra associated with a massive astrogliosis and the presence of activated microglial cells. 
In line with this possibility, an activation of proteases such as caspase-3 and caspase-8, which are known effectors of apoptosis, has been reported in Parkinson's disease. 
Inhibition of the glial reaction and the inflammatory processes may thus represent a therapeutic target to reduce neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
PET studies in patients with Parkinson's disease have lent further support to the proposed circuit abnormalities. 
 The study of immature midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and dopaminergic cell lines in culture provides an opportunity to analyze mechanisms of cell death and avenues of potential intervention relevant to Parkinson's disease (PD) in a controlled environment. 
 Experimental intoxication models are used to study the more common sporadic form of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The studies of these transcription factors have not only increased the understanding of how DA neurons are generated in vivo, but also allowed the development of new strategies using stem cells for engineering DA neurons in vitro, results that may have significance in future therapies of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Midbrain dopaminergic neurons are the main source of dopamine in the mammalian central nervous system and are associated with one of the most prominent human neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease. 
Interestingly, alpha-synuclein, a gene recently linked to familial forms of Parkinson's disease, is regulated by engrailed-1 and -2. 
 Positron emission tomography (PET) can detect the presence of striatal, pallidal, midbrain, and cortical dopamine terminal dysfunction in vivo in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The behavior of neurons in the basal ganglia is severely disrupted in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the major cause of parkinsonism. 
 Cabergoline is a synthetic ergoline dopamine agonist with a high affinity for D(2) receptors indicated for use in both early and advanced Parkinson's disease and in hyperprolactinaemic disorders. 
Mild to moderate renal and hepatic impairment, administration of food and the use of concomitant antiparkinsonian medications, such as levodopa and selegiline, have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of cabergoline.The pharmacokinetic properties of cabergoline allow once daily administration in patients with Parkinson's disease and twice weekly administration in patients with hyperprolactinaemia, making this drug advantageous over other dopaminergic agents in term of both therapeutic compliance and better symptom control. 
The current study investigated the relationship between the 2 imaging modalities in evaluating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: Twenty patients in whom PD was diagnosed by generally accepted criteria were recruited. 
 A variety of mechanisms have been proposed as explanations for the distinctive neuropathology of Parkinson's disease, such as increased iron levels, increased oxidant stress or decreased antioxidant defences. 
 Preclinical studies suggest ropinirole (a D2/D3 dopamine agonist) may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease (PD), and a pilot clinical study using (18)F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) suggested a slower loss of striatal dopamine storage with ropinirole compared with levodopa. 
 Dopamine (DA)- or L-dihydroxyphenylalanine-(L-DOPA-) induced neurotoxicity is thought to be involved not only in adverse reactions induced by long-term L-DOPA therapy but also in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Since tyrosinase also possesses catecholamine-synthesizing activity in the absence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the double-edged synthesizing and oxidizing functions of tyrosinase in the dopaminergic system suggest its potential for application in the synthesis of DA, instead of TH in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and in the normalization of abnormal DA turnover in the long-term L-DOPA-treated Parkinson's disease patients. 
 The mechanisms responsible for the pathological deposition of brain iron in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other human neurodegenerative disorders remain poorly understood. 
 The neurotoxin MPTP can damage dopamine systems in the brains of rodents, cats, or monkeys, and is therefore widely used to model degenerative processes that underlie human Parkinson's disease. 
These systems are closely involved in several diseases of the nervous system including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. 
The physiological significance of neuromelanin and its contribution to the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease are still controversial. 
Since the population of neurons that die in Parkinson's disease are those that display obvious intralysosomal neuromelanin and since cytosolic dopamine-dependent oxyradical formation may underlie methamphetamine toxicity and other specific forms of neurodegeneration in dopaminergic neurons, it is important to elucidate the pathways leading to production of dopamine-quinone. 
 Epidemiological studies have shown a reduced incidence of cancer in Parkinson's disease. 
Moreover, blockade of A(2A) receptors has been previously shown to suppress parkinsonian-like symptoms (catalepsy, akinesia, muscle rigidity) in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 To study changes in amino acid metabolism and biogenic amines in Parkinson's disease, we set up a prospective study and measured biogenic amines, their main metabolites, and 22 different amino acids, in cerebrospinal fluid of Parkinson's disease patients (n = 24) and age-matched controls (n = 30). 
A trend toward higher dopamine levels in Parkinson's disease patients was interpreted as an effect of treatment with levodopa and/or selegiline. 
Significantly lower concentrations of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the Parkinson's disease group might reflect dopaminergic cell loss. 
Whereas all amino acid levels were unchanged, taurine was significantly lower in Parkinson's disease patients. 
In this view, decreased taurine in a neurodegenerative disorder as Parkinson's disease deserves attention. 
 Tetrahydroisoquinolines present in the mammalian brain, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) and salsolinol, suspected to cause neurodegeneration leading to Parkinson's disease, were investigated to find their possible physiological role. 
In this animal model for Parkinson's disease (PD), the effect of destroying ascending DA pathways on extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT innervation in rat striatum were examined. 
 Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a worldwide neurodegenerative disorder. 
 We determined whether the preferential toxicity of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on dopamine-producing cells, which we have previously observed in vitro, might also occur in vivo and generate characteristics associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, this animal model generated by the administration of BH4, the molecule endogenously present in the monoaminergic neurons, exhibited morphological, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics associated with Parkinson's disease and may be useful for studies in dopaminergic degeneration. 
 BACKGROUND: Posteroventral pallidotomy is a widely accepted surgical procedure for treating medically intractable Parkinson's disease and Levo-dopa induced dyskinesia.

 An 8-month multicentre prospective randomized study aimed at comparing the effects of dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole (PPX; Mirapexin) and pergolide (PRG; Permax) as add-on to L-dopa therapy on depression [Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)] in 41 non-demented patients (25 men, 16 women) suffering from both mild or moderate depression and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Twelve patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD), none of whom had received any previous L-DOPA treatment, but using other antiparkinsonian drugs, were studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra but also by a degeneration of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons. 
Based on the present findings and existing reports, it can be concluded that noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus have neuromodulatory and neuroprotective properties on the dopaminergic neurons of basal ganglia and that noradrenergic degeneration may contribute to the aetiology and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
It suggests that the retrograde nourishment of GDNF to the dopaminergic neurons and the balanced activity of different nuclei in the basal ganglia circuit after EA may contribute to the behavioral improvement in these rats, which might be the factors that underlie the effectiveness of EA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 SPECT scanning using (99)Tc-TRODAT-1, a ligand that binds to dopamine transporters, may be useful for detection of early Parkinson's disease (PD), diagnosis of presymptomatic individuals, and monitoring disease progression. 
 Psychosis only rarely occurs in patients with untreated Parkinson's disease. 
Much more commonly, psychosis is induced by drug therapy for Parkinson's disease and is the strongest known risk factor for nursing home placement. 
If symptoms persist, anti-Parkinson's disease medications are slowly reduced. 
Ziprasidone is the only agent whose adverse effect profile has not been reported in Parkinson's disease. 
The most common adverse effects of clozapine in Parkinson's disease are sedation, orthostatic hypotension and sialorrhoea. 
In risperidone-treated Parkinson's disease patients, reported adverse effects include somnolence, sialorrhoea, dizziness, palpitations, constipation, delirium, fatigue, leg cramps, depression, urinary incontinence and hypotension. 
Although in some Parkinson's disease studies, risperidone has been well tolerated, others have shown that many patients are unable to tolerate the drug due to deterioration of motor function. 
While an initial study of olanzapine in Parkinson's disease psychosis showed the drug to be effective without deterioration of motor function, succeeding reports demonstrated a deleterious effect of the drug on motor functioning. 
The most common adverse effects of quetiapine in Parkinson's disease patients are sedation and orthostatic hypotension. 
There is a lack of double-blind trials; however, cumulative reports involving >200 Parkinson's disease patients strongly suggest that quetiapine is well tolerated and effective. 
Recently, cholinesterase inhibitors have been reported to alleviate psychosis in Parkinson's disease. 
Although ondansetron, an antiemetic with antiserotonergic properties, has been reported to relieve psychosis in Parkinson's disease, its prohibitive cost has prevented further study in this population.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant amantadine therapy versus placebo in treating dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa, and suffering from motor complications. 
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing amantadine with placebo in the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials were found comparing amantadine with placebo in the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Due to lack of evidence it is impossible to determine whether amantadine is a safe and effective form of treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These symptoms often occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, or Parkinson's disease. 
As the average age of Americans increases, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease will rise accordingly.

 PURPOSE: In patients with Parkinson's disease an imbalance between stimulatory D2-like receptors and inhibitory D1-like receptors may contribute to detrusor overactivity. 
 BACKGROUND: Porcine embryonic neural tissue transplanted intracerebrally could potentially relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease if the immune response toward the graft could be overcome. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), both neuropathologic and biochemical studies suggest that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) neurons are affected by the disease process. 
 The aim of this study was to do an initial assessment of the usefulness of 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)nortropane ((18)F-FECNT) PET scanning in determining in vivo brain dopamine transporter (DAT) density in healthy humans and subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: We investigated 6 neurologically healthy subjects and 5 PD patients: 2 with mild unilateral disease, 1 with mild-to-moderate bilateral disease, and 2 with moderately severe bilateral disease. 
This method allows investigation of the effect of cortical stimulation on glutamate-dopamine-GABA interactions in the striatum in vitro that might help to understand better the neurochemical background of schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease.

 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with selective loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
In the present study we determined, both in vitro and in vivo, whether the cell death induced by this endogenous molecule involves apoptosis, resembling that which occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
These data provide evidence that the dopaminergic cell death induced by BH4 involves apoptosis and suggest relevance of this cell death to degeneration of the dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease.

 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the polymorphism of dopamine beta hydroxylase(DBH) gene and the susceptibility of Shanghai Chinese Han population to Parkinson's disease(PD). 
Because cholecystokinin and its receptors (A and B) have a functional interaction with dopaminergic neurotransmission, alterations in them may constitute a predisposition for Parkinson's disease. 
We performed a case-control study to investigate the association between the cholecystokinin system and Parkinson's disease using genetic markers for three genes: cholecystokinin and its two receptors (A and B). 
One hundred and sixty patients with Parkinson's disease and 160 controls, matched for age, gender, ethnic origin and area of residence, were recruited. 
These three gene polymorphisms showed no correlation with risk of Parkinson's disease; however, the cholecystokinin CT/TT genotype was associated with a 4.429-fold increased risk for visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. 
Cholecystokinin-A receptor and B receptor polymorphisms, considered alone, showed no correlation with hallucinations in Parkinson's disease; however, a combined effect was found in patients with hallucinations harboring both the cholecystokinin CT/TT and cholecystokinin-A receptor TC/CC genotypes. 
Parkinson's disease patients harboring this genotype have a 5.922-fold increased risk for developing visual hallucinations. 
These results suggest that, in Chinese, visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease are associated with cholecystokinin -45C>T polymorphism, and this association was still observed in the presence of the cholecystokinin-A receptor TC/CC genotype, indicating a possible interaction of these two genes in the visual hallucinogenesis in Parkinson's disease. 
 The aetiology of sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson's disease is multifactorial. 
Somnolence, excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks appear to be more common in patients with Parkinson's disease who are treated with dopamine receptor agonists than in those who are treated with other antiparkinsonian agents, although virtually all dopaminergic antiparkinsonian medications may contribute to sleepiness. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease and caregivers should be informed about the risk of sleepiness and sleep attacks associated with dopaminergic medications and the potential implications for driving safety. 
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Shourong compound formula on treating Parkinson's disease. 
METHOD: Parkinson's disease model mice induced by reserpine was used and by HPLC-ED the levels of Dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were determined. 
 Long-term treatment with levodopa in Parkinson's disease results in the development of motor complications, including drug failure, reduced duration of antiparkinsonian action (wearing off phenomenon), sudden shifts between under-treated and over-treated states (on-off phenomenon), freezing and involuntary movements such as levodopainduced dyskinesia. 
Consequently, antiparkinsonian agents should only be proposed within the framework of a differential diagnosis between parkinsonism and idiopathic Parkinson's disease then continued only if the risk/benefit ratio, systematically evaluated for each patient, is favorable. 
Accordingly, the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists memantine and amantadine increase striatal dopamine levels, the latter being widely used in Parkinson's disease therapy. 
 The simplest explanation for the selective loss of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) is that DA or a metabolite is neurotoxic. 
A previous longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) study has indicated that, in the striatum of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, dopamine D(2) receptor binding declines at a relatively fast annual rate of 2-4% (compared to the rate of <1%/year in healthy individuals). 
 Epidemiological data suggest that the steroid hormone 17beta-estradiol plays an important role in protecting the brain from neurodegenerative processes, including that causing the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
The present study sought to further investigate the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of 17beta-estradiol in a murine model of Parkinson's disease, i.e. 
In order to realize the therapeutic potential of the neuroprotective effect of 17beta-estradiol for Parkinson's disease, it will be necessary to identify synthetic estrogen receptor modulators that lack the activity of the steroid on peripheral tissue. 
 The molecular mechanisms mediating degeneration of midbrain dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. 
Similar behavioural disorders might therefore occur in the presymptomatic stage of human Parkinson's disease. 
 The herbicide paraquat is an environmental factor that could be involved in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. 
 Changes in the control of dopaminergic neurotransmission by noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) projections has been implicated in such disorders as depression, drug addiction, and Parkinson's disease. 
This leads to the possibility that some symptoms of Parkinson's disease or senile dementia might be improved by exercise. 
 Fluctuations in response to levodopa in patients in the advanced stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease occur frequently and are a difficult problem to treat. 
Continuous stimulation of dopamine receptors with dopaminergic agents is one of the crucial basic steps in the treatment of patients at an advanced stage of Parkinson's disease, and the preferential use of dopamine receptor agonists has proven to be successful in the prevention and treatment of response fluctuations. 
Our findings indicate that nicotine increases CYP2E1 at very low doses and may enhance CYP2E1-related toxicity in smokers, passive smokers, and people treated with nicotine (e.g., smokers, patients with Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis or Parkinson's disease).

Consequently, the effect of D(2) agonists in the clinical treatment of Parkinson's disease may be due to stimulation of postsynaptic D(2) receptors rather than presynaptic autoreceptors. 
 In humans, mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene or exposure to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) produce Parkinson's disease with loss of dopaminergic neurons and depletion of nigrostriatal dopamine.

 Nigrostriatal damage leads to a reduction in striatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in rodents, monkeys, and patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These data suggest that the declines in nAChR sites observed in Parkinson's disease brains may be of functional significance.

Clozapine is the only officially approved drug for psychosis in Parkinson's disease. 
In this respect, in Parkinson's disease dopamine depletion will favour adaptive responses at the cellular level which likely involve differentially the dopaminergic receptor subtypes.

 Alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic protein that has been implicated as a possible causative agent in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
The native protein is a major component of nigral Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, and full-length alpha-synuclein accumulates in Lewy neurites. 
However, the accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein with long-term cocaine abuse may put addicts at increased risk for developing the motor abnormalities of Parkinson's disease. 
 Whereas dopamine agonists are known to provide symptomatic benefits for Parkinson's disease, recent clinical trials suggest that they might also be neuroprotective. 
 Glutathione (GSH) depletion is the earliest biochemical alteration shown to date in brains of Parkinson's disease patients. 
In this study, therefore, we show that the signaling pathway AA/12-LOX/12-HPETE/GC/PKG may be important in several pathologies in which GSH decrease has been documented, such as Parkinson's disease. 
As alterations in DA neurotransmission have been implicated in a number of human neuropathologies including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, understanding how specific genes are involved in the function of DA neurons and the compensatory changes that result from loss or reduction in gene expression could provide important insight for the treatment of these diseases. 
This hypothesis was tested using an animal model of Parkinson's disease in which male Wistar rats were lesioned in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) by the intranigral infusion of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), thus causing a partial depletion of striatal dopamine. 
 Striatal neurons which are immunoreactive (ir) to aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) or tyrosine hydrodroxylase (TH) may play a role in the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to dopamine (DA) in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In conclusion, our present data provide strong evidence that HFS does not only need presynaptic GABA(A) receptors but also intact GABAergic nerve terminals coupled to GABA(A) receptors to exert an inhibitory effect and give a rationale of HFS effectiveness in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Preliminary observations suggest the possible value of cholinesterase inhibitors in the amelioration of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, dementia with Lewy bodies, and in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 To explore changes in melatonin secretion patterns and biologic rhythms in Parkinson's disease patients with or without levodopa-related motor complications (LDRMCs), the authors investigated, in an observational study, circadian rhythms of central temperature, motor activity, plasma cortisol, and melatonin in three groups: de novo untreated patients (group I), patients treated with levodopa + dopamine agonist and without LDRMCs (group II), and patients treated with levodopa + dopamine agonist and with LDRMCs (group III).

 The concept of replacing lost dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease using mesencephalic brain cells from fetal cadavers has been supported by over 20 years of research in animals and over a decade of clinical studies. 
The ambitious goal of these studies was no less than a molecular and cellular "cure" for Parkinson's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, and spinal cord injury. 
Early uncontrolled clinical reports were enthusiastic, but the outcome of the first randomized, double blind, controlled study challenged the idea that dopamine replacement cells can cure Parkinson's disease, although there were some significant positive findings.

 The powerful trophic effects that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exerts on midbrain dopamine neurones suggest its use in treating Parkinson's disease. 
Here we demonstrate that the chronic infusion of 5 or 15 micro g/day GDNF into the lateral ventricle or the striatum, using programmable pumps, promotes restoration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and significantly improves motor functions in rhesus monkeys with neural deficits modelling the terminal stages of Parkinson's disease. 
In addition, chronic GDNF treatment did not induce the side-effects generally associated with chronic administration of levodopa, the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, the results suggest that the prolonged and controlled delivery of GDNF into the brain could be used to intervene in long-term neurodegenerative disease processes like Parkinson's disease.

(2) In 1996, selegiline, a type B MAOI marketed in France since 1988, saw its indications extended to cover single-agent therapy of early-stage Parkinson's disease, and in combination with levodopa, before onset of complications of levodopa therapy. 
(3) Now, in 2002, new data from trials involving hundreds of untreated patients show that selegiline postpones the need for levodopa therapy for a few months but fails to substantially alter the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
(4) A clinical trial and a retrospective epidemiological study of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease showed excess mortality on selegiline. 
(7) Given the only moderate effects of selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility of a slight increase in mortality, there is no justification for prescribing this medication in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Drug-induced paraphilias and hypersexuality may represent a reversal of the putative premorbid Parkinson's disease personality traits of introversion, cautious behavior, and lack of "novelty-seeking." A biologic basis for transvestism, and paraphilias in general, is not known. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to review recent neuroimaging contributions to our understanding of the cause and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, as well as treatment-related complications of disease, with a focus on functional anatomy and neurochemistry. 
SUMMARY: Functional imaging studies can provide novel insights into the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, as well as the mechanisms that contribute to complications of long-term therapy. 
 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder. 
RECENT FINDINGS: Experimental therapeutics in Parkinson's disease has focused on prevention of levodopa complications, treatment of dyskinesias associated with levodopa therapy, surgical intervention and neuroprotection. 
SUMMARY: There are at least four important implications of the recent therapeutic trials: (1) the incidence of levodopa-related dyskinesias decreases as a result of initial use of dopamine agonists; (2) surgery, primarily in the form of the bilateral, high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, is highly effective in patients who are responsive to levodopa but experience marked motor fluctuation or other complications; (3) while neuroprotection has not yet been demonstrated with any currently used therapeutic agent, improved understanding of mechanisms of cell death will undoubtedly result in the discovery of new drugs with potential disease-modifying effects; and (4) implantation of fetal mesencephalon tissue and other grafts may be effective in younger patients with Parkinson's disease, but is associated with significant complications and remains experimental. 
The frequency of delusions and visual hallucinations was increased in Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, suggesting common mechanisms such as Lewy body pathology and cholinergic deficiency. 
 Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene (A30P and A53T) are reported to cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not known how they result in selective dopaminergic cell death. 
 Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on the presentation of clinical symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity. 
 Dopamine (DA), a major neurotransmitter used in the striatum, is involved in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. 
 Mutations in alpha-synuclein have been linked to rare, autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease. 
Because extravesicular, cytoplasmic dopamine can be easily oxidized into reactive oxygen species and other toxic metabolites, mutations in alpha-synuclein might lead to Parkinson's disease by triggering protracted, low grade dopamine toxicity resulting in terminal degeneration and ultimately cell death. 
CONCLUSIONS: These experiments show that GCM has protective and restorative effects in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) alleviates Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms.

 The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is higher in males than in females. 
We demonstrated that ligand-activated estrogen receptor beta suppressed dopaminergic neuronal death in an in vitro Parkinson's disease model which uses 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ions (MPP(+)).

 Environmental toxicants and, in particular, pesticides have been implicated as risk factors in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), alterations of executive functions also suggest a role for DA in regulating cognitive functions.

In these animals, as in Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic neurons of the nigro-striatal pathway undergo spontaneous and progressive cell death. 
 Several mechanisms are thought to be involved in the progressive decline in neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) that leads to Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a severe loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
We show here that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is due, at least in part, to the release of dopamine in the striatum. 
 Historically, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) has been considered to be an inert amino acid that alleviates the symptoms of Parkinson's disease by its conversion to dopamine via the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase.

 BACKGROUND: Drugs that mimic dopamine such as bromocriptine were introduced as monotherapy or in a combination with LD in the hope that this approach would prevent or delay the onset of motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be caused by environmental neurotoxins such as pesticides, however the major risk factor is old age. 
We postulated that the high incidence of Parkinson's disease in older people is secondary to age-related impairment of the hepatic detoxification of xenobiotics. 
Here, we investigated whether there are age-related differences in the hepatic disposition of MPTP and pesticides, putatively associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Ageing may increase risk of Parkinson's disease by altering hepatic detoxification and increasing systemic bioavailability of neurotoxins. 
 Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor for dopamine neurons that has been proposed for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine agonists play an important role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by reducing the administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). 
The enzymatic and non-enzymatic conversion of L-DOPA is suspected to increase oxidative stress, which leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Our previous work showed that there were marked declines in (125)I-alpha-conotoxin MII labeled nicotinic receptors in monkey basal ganglia after nigrostriatal damage, findings that suggest alpha3/alpha6 containing nicotinic receptors sites may be of relevance to Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, if activation of striatal nicotinic receptors is key in the regulation of basal ganglia function, alpha3/alpha6-directed nicotinic receptor ligands may be more relevant for Parkinson's disease therapy. 
The treatment of Parkinson's disease unresponsive to dopaminergic substances and that associated with dementia remains problematical.

Although AMPA receptor-mediated transmission is functionally overactive in Parkinson's disease and dyskinesia, changes in striatal AMPA receptor levels are not likely to be the cause of such movement disorders. 
 Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of brain dopamine neurons.

 INTRODUCTION: In the present study, we determined whether certain proteins known to mediate dopamine signaling in striatum show abnormal levels in Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: Protein levels were assayed by western blotting in samples of caudate nucleus and putamen obtained at autopsy from patients with Parkinson's disease and from control subjects. 
RESULTS: Levels of the transcription factor DeltaFosB and of the G protein modulatory protein RGS9 were both increased in caudate and putamen from patients with Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with observations in laboratory animals, which have demonstrated elevated levels of DeltaFosB in striatum after denervation of the midbrain dopamine system, and confirm that similar adaptations in DeltaFosB and RGS9 occur in humans with Parkinson's disease. 
Knowledge of these adaptations can help us understand the changes in striatal function associated with Parkinson's disease and assist in the development of novel treatments. 
 In a model of Parkinson's disease (PD), amphetamine, a dopamine (DA)-releasing drug, fails to induce ipsilateral drug rotations in a proportion of rats with complete unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle and DA neurons of the substantia nigra. 
Monoamine-oxidase B (MAO-B) has been reported to be implicated in both MPTP-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease, since selegiline (L-deprenyl), an irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, prevents MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in numerous species including mice, goldfish and drosophyla.

 The substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (PD) is depleted of dopaminergic neurons and contains fibrillar Lewy bodies comprising primarily alpha-synuclein. 
 Recent results have suggested that some products of mercapturic acid pathway (MAP) metabolism of oxidized dopamine (DA) may contribute to mesostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and that at least one product, 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (Cys-DA), is elevated in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who have been treated with L-DOPA. 
 The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) causes, via its metabolite MPP(+), damages of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease. 
 While the pathophysiological changes induced by the loss of dopamine innervation in the basal ganglia by Parkinson's disease (PD) are well studied, little is known about functional changes in the neural circuitry of this area during normal aging. 
 There are several problems related to the diagnosis and the biochemical background of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The therapeutic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on clinical performance was assessed by a double-blind study in 9 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. 
Dopamine-related pathological disorders can be associated with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or with false motivational attributions such as drug dependence. 
A less costly and more available test such as a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be helpful in the diagnosis of early or atypical Parkinson's disease (PD) if its sensitivity is comparable to a PET scan. 
 A distinctive personality type, characterized by introversion, inflexibility, and low novelty seeking, has been suggested to be associated with Parkinson's disease. 
To test the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease is associated with a specific dopamine-related personality type, the personality structures of 61 unmedicated Parkinson's disease patients and 45 healthy controls were examined. 
Additionally, in 47 Parkinson's disease patients, the dopaminergic function in the brain was directly measured with 6-[(18)F]fluoro-l-dopa ((18)F-dopa) positron emission tomography (PET) with MRI coregistration. 
The novelty-seeking personality score, supposedly associated with the parkinsonian personality, was slightly lower in the Parkinson's disease group compared with controls, but it did not have a significant relationship with (18)F-dopa uptake in any of the brain regions studied (r = -0.12 to 0.11, P > 0.15). 
The harm-avoidance personality score, associated with anxiety and depression, was clearly increased in patients with Parkinson's disease and it had a paradoxical, highly significant positive correlation with the (18)F-dopa uptake in the right caudate nucleus (r = 0.53, P = 0.04, Bonferroni corrected for 220 comparisons). 
Although the results of this study are not in disagreement with the concept of low-novelty-seeking personality type in Parkinson's disease, the personality type does not seem to be dopamine dependent. 
The correlation between the personality trait of harm avoidance and (18)F-dopa may reflect a specific feedback circuitry of neurotransmitters that is associated with negative emotionality in Parkinson's disease. 
 The aim of this study was to compare parkinsonian features and loss of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) function in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD), matched for age and disease duration. 
DDC has been implicated in a number of clinic disorders, including Parkinson's disease and hypertension. 
It is highly warranted to ask how well these models simulate the state of chronic denervation and sustained L-DOPA pharmacotherapy which are typical of advanced Parkinson's disease. 
The present data provide the first demonstration that L-DOPA maintains high striatal levels of fosB and prodynorphin gene expression during a prolonged course of treatment, which simulates the clinical practice in Parkinson's disease more closely than the short-treatment paradigms studied thus far. 
 The opioid peptides localized in striatal projection neurons are of great relevance to Parkinson's disease, not only as a consequence of their distribution, but also due to the pronounced changes in expression seen in Parkinson's disease. 
It has long been suspected that increased expression of enkephalin may represent one of the many mechanisms that compensate for dopamine (DA) depletion in Parkinson's disease. 
Here we demonstrate that a systemically delivered, selective delta opioid agonist (SNC80) has potent antiparkinsonian actions in both rat and primate models of Parkinson's disease. 
Any treatment that serves to increase delta opioid receptor activation may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, either in the early stages or as an adjunct to dopamine replacement therapy. 
Furthermore, enhanced enkephalin expression observed in Parkinson's disease may serve to potentiate dopamine acting preferentially at D1 receptors. 
These findings may be particularly relevant to the potential approaches to rescue and prolong the survival of neurons by estrogens in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The antiviral drug amantadine, that is effective in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), may affect the composition and function of peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
 BACKGROUND: Recent case reports and letters have alerted practitioners to the risk of sleep attacks, usually preceded by somnolence, in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with pramipexole and ropinirole. 
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the risk of somnolence with the new dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSION: Patients with Parkinson's disease using pramipexole or ropinirole are at higher risk of experiencing somnolence relative to patients taking placebo. 
These results have led us to propose that prolonged TBZ administration could provide a novel and useful model for the behavioral characteristics and anatomical pathology of Parkinson's disease as one of the oxidative stress models induced by abnormal dopamine metabolism. 
Soon after this, dopamine, or more specifically the depletion of dopamine, was clearly implicated in Parkinson's disease. 
Adrogolide improves behavioral disability and locomotor activity scores in MPTP-lesioned marmosets, a model of Parkinson's disease (PD), and shows no tolerance upon repeated dosing for 28 days.

 OBJECTIVES: Impaired proprioception has been previously reported in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: In 17 patients with Parkinson's disease, arm proprioception was tested in the practically defined "off" state, and retested 1 hour after taking levodopa or dopamine agonist. 
 A possible source for transplantable neurons in Parkinson's disease are adult olfactory bulb (OB) dopamine (DA) progenitors that originate in the anterior subventricular zone and reach the OB through the rostral migratory stream. 
Parkinson's disease was diagnosed therefore L-dopa and Cabergoline were administered. 
Cases involving dropped head syndrome due to Parkinson's disease are reportedly improved by L-dopa, but exasperated by dopamine agonists. 
Dropped head in the present case may have been a complication of Parkinson's disease since it improved in response to L-dopa. 
 We carried out behavioral, pathological, and biochemical studies in order to determine whether the stereo-structure of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1-MeTIQ) affects the onset of Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, which are induced by 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) in mice. 
We concluded that (R)-1-MeTIQ, and not (S)-enantiomer, plays a crucial role in protection against TIQ-induced parkinsonism, a fact which suggests that enantiomeric biochemical events such as 1-MeTIQ biosynthesis may participate in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
The use of this antipsychotic in Parkinson's disease is still controversial. 
We describe a 59 year-old bipolar patient with Parkinson's disease non-responding to conventional antimanic drugs successfully treated with risperidone. 
The important therapeutic consequences of a better understanding of facilitation of working memory is discussed in reference to schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
 AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether use of antiparkinsonian drugs in pharmacy records can be used as a marker for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide are often used in Japan to treat Parkinson's disease. 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in Japan. 
DESIGN AND SETTING: We used a Markov model to simulate the course of Parkinson's disease and to compare the cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists added to levodopa with that of levodopa alone in Japan. 
The model assumed that 60-year-old men with Parkinson's disease in Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stages 2 to 5 using levodopa were administered dopamine agonists or continued on levodopa alone. 
CONCLUSIONS: Dopamine agonists appear to be cost effective in advanced Parkinson's disease, although their use is sensitive to the costs and effectiveness of dopamine agonists. 
If factors discouraging the prescription of generic drugs in Japan were removed, the treatment of Parkinson's disease would become more cost effective. 
 In animal models of Parkinson's disease, gene transfer of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) leads to an increase in the capacity of the striatum to decarboxylate exogenous L-DOPA. 
In addition to the potential clinical benefit of improving decarboxylation efficiency in Parkinson's disease, our approach may be relevant for the treatment of AADC deficiency, a rare, autosomal recessive disorder causing a severe movement disorder and progressive cognitive impairment. 
The sustained alterations in the nigrostriatal pathway resemble the cardinal signs of human Parkinson's disease and suggest that this chronic mouse model is potentially useful to study the pathophysiology and mechanisms of Parkinsonism. 
The results indicate that the visual deficits found in Parkinson's disease patients my be not solely related to retinal dysfunctions.

 Riluzole is an antiexcitotoxic agent used for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and reported to have neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and brain ischemia. 
 The question of whether to use levodopa (LD) or dopamine agonists as initial therapy in Parkinson's disease has been a controversy for nearly 20 years. 
LD decreases mortality in Parkinson's disease. 
Dopamine agonists do provide some symptomatic relief when used alone in early Parkinson's disease. 
Our findings also may provide a rationale for the identification of astrocytes as a prominent target for the development of new therapies of Parkinson's disease. 
 The cloning of the gene for the D3 receptor and subsequent identification of its distribution in brain and pharmacology allowed for serious consideration of the possibility that it might be a target for drugs used to treat schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease (PD). 
PET has revealed loss of dopaminergic terminals and dopamine synthetic capacity in Parkinson's disease, MPTP intoxication, and Lesch-Nyhan's syndrome; release of dopamine after administration of cocaine and amphetamine, and in motor activity and cognition; increased synaptic dopamine and release of dopamine, and the 70-90% neuroleptic occupancy of dopamine receptors in the striatum, in patients with schizophrenia; loss of muscarinic and nicotinergic receptors in Alzheimer's disease, and benzodiazepine and opiate receptors in stroke, epilepsy, and Huntington's chorea; altered opiate receptors in chronic pain and drug abuse; and release of opiates in analgesia; but changes in serotonin synthesis, transport, and binding in affective or psychotic disorders remain elusive. 
The new discoveries have greatly stimulated preclinical and clinical studies to explore the neuropharmacology of DA receptors and their implications in the neuropathophysiology of different neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
This suggests that some widely used antidepressants that inhibit the dopamine transporter may benefit patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings may therefore provide new insights into the functional interaction between the glutamatergic and the dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems and foster novel therapeutic concepts for the early and middle phases of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with clinical features of bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability resulting from the deficiency of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system. 
 Although patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience pelvic organ dysfunction of the urinary bladder, bowel and genital organs, an accurate incidence of the dysfunction and its characteristics have yet to be ascertained. 
 The dopamine system is known to be closely involved in brain neuronal dysfunction and in diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, generation of pituitary tumors and schizophrenia. 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disease caused by rather selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF MF) on the reactivity of the central dopamine D(1) receptor in rats with dopamine neurons chemically damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), an animal model of human's Parkinson's disease. 
To determine whether the relationship between activity in this network and the principal afferent of the basal ganglia, the cortex, is altered in a model of Parkinson's disease, we recorded unit activity in the subthalamic nucleus-globus pallidus network together with cortical electroencephalogram in control and 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats under urethane anaesthesia. 
This may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. 
This distribution may provide the basis for a selective dopamine neuron loss in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Brain tissue from 44 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 36 age-matched controls was examined for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and for densities of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. 
These findings implicate the thalamus as a novel site for disease specific alterations in dopamine neurotransmission, such as exist with nigral degeneration attending Parkinson's disease. 
These results show the occurrence of functional interactions among mGlu(5), adenosine A(2A), and dopamine D(2) receptors in the regulation of striatal functioning, and suggest that mGlu(5) receptors may be regarded as alternative/integrative targets for the development of therapeutic strategies in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Success of the latter is attested to the ability of the following low affinity compounds to be marketed: 1) Cough suppressant-dextromethorphan (available for decades); 2) Parkinson's disease--amantadine, memantine and budipine; 3) Dementia--memantine; and 4) Epilepsy--felbamate. 
 In the present study we demonstrate neuroprotective property of green tea extract and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mice model of Parkinson's disease. 
The progressive degeneration of these cells in patients with Parkinson's disease, and the potential therapeutic benefit by transplantation of in vitro generated dopamine cells, has triggered intense interest in understanding the process whereby these cells develop. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the basal ganglia, associated with the inappropriate death of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). 
So insulin is proposed as a kind of neuropeptide precursor in the brain and insulin-derived peptides may be involved in the process of regulating the DA system, and these peptides may be developed into new medicines for disorders concerning the DA system such as Parkinson's disease and cocaine addiction. 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a selective loss of dopamine in the striatum. 
Problems remain in the accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 imaging in the evaluation of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease.METHODS: Thirty-four patients with early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease were recruited. 
For all patients, the Parkinson's disease was stage 2 or less as assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. 
RESULTS: A continuous reduction in specific striatal uptake of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 with increasing disease severity was found in Parkinson's disease patients (control vs. 
No remarkable adverse reactions were found in either healthy volunteers or Parkinson's disease patients during or after imaging. 
CONCLUSION: For clinical practice, 99mTc-TRODAT-1 may serve as a useful imaging agent for the early detection of Parkinson's disease. 
 It has been over three decades since the introduction of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine or levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This study first and foremost aims to maximally serve the safety interests of the individual patient while simultaneously serving the public interest in rigorously determining in a scientific fashion if gene therapy can be effective to any degree in treating Parkinson's disease. 
 Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that was recently introduced for the treatment of both early and advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Shown to be safe and effective as add-on therapy, pramipexole can also be used as initial dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease, delaying the introduction of levodopa thereby postponing levodopa's side-effects. 
 The pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be elucidated. 
 High nonphysiological doses of l-dopa are administered to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, to replenish the depleted dopamine (DA). 
 Neural progenitor cells potentially provide a limitless, on-demand source of cells for grafting into patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) if the signals needed to control their conversion into dopamine (DA) neurons could be identified. 
Thus, monoamine transporters are target sites of drugs, and functional changes in the transporters may be involved in the pathogenesis of affective diseases, schizophrenia and/or personality disorders including neurogenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
 The concept of a threshold of dopamine (DA) depletion for onset of Parkinson's disease symptoms, although widely accepted, has, to date, not been determined experimentally in nonhuman primates in which a more rigorous definition of the mechanisms responsible for the threshold effect might be obtained. 
This is due to (1) greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying methamphetamine neurotoxicity, (2) its usefulness as a model for Parkinson's disease and (3) an increased abuse of the substance, especially in the American Mid-West and Japan. 
These findings suggested that a "catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancer" compound, (-)-BPAP, stimulates motor function in rats and improves motor deficits in animal models of Parkinson's disease due to its ability to induce dopamine release. 
 There is increasing interest in the identification of biological markers for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
A2A receptor antagonists provide a novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 We assessed nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing a double-blind, placebo-controlled surgical trial of embryonic dopamine cell implantation. 
 To clarify the role of neuronal complex 1 activity in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), expression of mitochondrial mRNA encoding the ND1 subunit of mitochondrial complex I was examined by semiquantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry in melanized neurons of human substantia nigra in IPD cases and control subjects. 
Because mitochondrial complex I activity is significantly reduced in IPD, intrinsically low expression of glycolytic enzymes, together with disease-related reduction in complex I activity, may be a contributory factor predisposing nigral neurons  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a high burden of morbidity. 
Little is known as to its effects on mesencephalic dopamine neurons, the major neurons lost in Parkinson's disease. 
 The power of placebos has long been recognized for improving numerous medical conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 OBJECTIVES: The cardiovascular effects of the peripheral dopamine D2-receptor antagonist domperidone were studied in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease treated with continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine. 
CONCLUSION: Domperidone increases blood pressure and heart rate without inducing nocturnal hypertension in apomorphine treated patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a brain degenerative disorder with unknown etiology, and specific degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic cells is a morphological manifestation of the disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease neuroprotective therapy to rescue dopamine neurons has been proposed. 
These results suggest that propargylamines may rescue or protect dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
We hypothesize that DA receptor-mediated effects are critical for the development of treatment-related fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Although a number rat analogues of human Parkinson's disease have been developed for evaluating the efficacy of drug therapies, it is not known whether L-dopa has a similar selective action on the motor symptoms in the rat models. 
The phasic reward message is different from the more tonic enabling function of dopamine that is deficient in Parkinson's disease, indicating that dopamine neurons subserve different functions at different time scales. 
These findings provide in vivo evidence for a role of dopamine in controlling the flow of cortical activity through the striatum and may be of outstanding relevance for understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
 The ability of dopaminergic (DA) transplants to restore complex sensorimotor behaviors in experimental Parkinson's disease is dependent on graft survival and reinnervation and is likely to be further modified by complex functional graft-host interactions. 
These findings indicate the importance of the underlying functional architecture of complex sensorimotor behaviors, such as skilled forelimb use, and the DA neurotransmitter system for the plasticity of DA transplants to promoting a more complete behavioral recovery in experimental, and potentially, also in clinical forms of Parkinson's disease. 
 Fluctuations in motor disability and dyskinesias are the major problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 20 patients (12 men and 8 women, mean age 65 years) affected by severe Parkinson's disease (PD) with peak-dose and/or diphasic dyskinesias or painful dyskinesia were treated with amantadine (300 mg/day) as adjunctive therapy to current levodopa, carbidopa and dopaminoagonist. 
UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale), dyskinesias rating scale (DRS) and IGA (investigator global assessment) scale were used to evaluate the severity of PD symptoms during follow-up. 
 In the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease, administration of a dopaminergic agonist sensitizes rats to a subsequent administration of dopaminergic drugs given days apart (priming). 
 Neuroimaging studies of the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) are useful in the assessment of the dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 A clinical retrospective study was carried out in a population of 366 Parkinson's disease (PD) outpatients, to analyse the efficacy and tolerability of nonergoline and ergoline dopamine agonist (DA), in monotherapy or in combination with L-dopa. 
 Amantadine has been proved to be beneficial in Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of amantadine on the dopaminergic system by measuring the in vivo binding of [11-C]raclopride to D2 dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia of 6 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Dyskinesia, secondary to dopamine replacement therapy, is the major complication of currently available therapies for Parkinson's disease. 
Alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonists, such as idazoxan, can significantly reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned, nonhuman primate model of Parkinson's disease and in human. 
 De novo administration of long-acting dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, to patients with Parkinson's disease or to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated subhuman primates produces a lower incidence of dyskinesia than occurs with L-DOPA. 
This study compares the intensity of dyskinesia produced by combinations of L-DOPA and ropinirole and by these drugs alone, using the MPTP-treated common marmoset model of Parkinson's disease. 
The objective is to determine the optimum therapeutic strategy for the long-term control of Parkinson's disease with a minimal risk of dyskinesia. 
These data suggest that in early Parkinson's disease, the use of ropinirole alone or in combination with a low-dose L-DOPA might delay the induction of dyskinesias while improving motor performance. 
This study examines the influence of total and partial sleep deprivation compared to normal sleep on motor state and performance in Parkinson's disease. 
Fifteen nondepressed patients with Parkinson's disease underwent one night of total sleep deprivation (TSD), one night of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) after 3 a.m., and one control night of normal sleep (S), performed in a random, nonconsecutive order. 
These data do not confirm previous findings of an overall positive influence of sleep deprivation on motor function in Parkinson's disease. 
 This study investigated whether chronic coadministration of alpha-dihydroergocryptine (DHEC) altered the plasma pharmacokinetics of individualized treatments with levodopa in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 We determined whether methylphenidate, a dopamine transporter blocker, modifies motor, cognitive, or affective responses to L-Dopa in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These precursor cells might serve as a useful source of human dopamine neurons for studying the development and degeneration of human dopamine neurons and may further serve as a continuous, on-demand source of cells for therapeutic transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Transplantation of fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue shows great promise as an experimental therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 (1) Levodopa is the cornerstone of therapy for Parkinson's disease, and bromocriptine is the reference drug for patients who develop motor complications on levodopa. 
Recently, different genetic defects have been associated with a variety of familial parkinsonian syndromes, the clinical phenotypes of which have varying degrees of similarities to idiopathic parkinsonism (IP), (sporadic Parkinson's disease). 
'Parkinson's disease', therefore, may not represent a single disease entity, but rather the final manifestation of different pathogenetic mechanisms-mediated by genetic or environmental factors, or an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. 
 Psychosis is quite common in Parkinson's disease (approximately 25% of patients) and therefore constitutes a serious public health problem. 
All patients suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and especially elderly and demented patients, are at risk of developing delusions or hallucinations. 
A Parkinson's disease-related cholinergic deficit in combination with an age-related further loss of cholinergic integrity also plays a prominent role. 
Psychosis in Parkinson's disease patients appears to be a more important contributor to caregiver distress than motor parkinsonism. 
Cholinomimetic therapy may prove to be helpful in the prevention and treatment of psychotic manifestations in Parkinson's disease patients, given the effects observed in patients suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies. 
 Recent work has shown substantial alterations in NMDA receptor subunit expression, assembly, and phosphorylation in the dopamine-depleted striatum of a rodent 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease.

 Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, is known to lower cardiovascular mortality in L-dopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease, probably by reducing the cardiac sympathetic activity. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease can experience a number of sleep disorders, including insomnia, parasomnias and daytime somnolence [specifically, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep attacks]. 
Both the pathology of Parkinson's disease and dopaminergic drugs may contribute to the much higher than expected frequency of sleep fragmentation and disrupted sleep among these patients. 
In addition, coexisting depression seems to be a major and frequent risk factor for insomnia in Parkinson's disease. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease experience a wide range of parasomnias. 
In addition, the atypical antipsychotics have given physicians new and better treatment options for psychotic symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease. 
EDS is common in Parkinson's disease, while sleep attacks seem to be rare manifestations of the disease or its treatment. 
Significant EDS is found in 15% of patients with Parkinson's disease compared with in 1% of healthy elderly people. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease should be informed about the possibility of developing sleep problems during the day when prescribed new drugs. 
 Oxidative stress, reactive oxygen (ROS), and nitrogen (RNS) species have been known to be involved in a multitude of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
 Dopamine is implicated in movement, learning, and motivation, and in illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. 
These results demonstrate that the immunophilin ligand GPI-1046 can reverse the abnormalities in the substantia nigra-striatal dopaminergic system that are caused by 6-OHDA, thus providing a potential therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease. 
 By the time a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is made, a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons has already occurred. 
 BACKGROUND: Embryonic xenogeneic neural tissue is an alternative for transplantation in Parkinson's disease, but immune responses limit the application. 
 Pergolide is an ergot-derived dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease and, increasingly, in restless legs syndrome. 
 Parkinson's disease affects various neurotransmitter systems. 
Using SPECT, the authors measured [(123)I]beta-CIT binding ratios of the caudate, putamen, medial thalamus, and dorsal midbrain over cerebellum in 16 patients with Parkinson's disease, and examined correlations with clinical ratings. 
These findings indicate that degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and a dysfunctional serotonergic raphe system contribute differentially to motor deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
 Today (2001) most strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD) are symptomatic. 
 Increased oxidative stresses are implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, and dopaminergic neurons may be intrinsically susceptible to oxidative damage. 
We hypothesize that BH(4) protects dopaminergic neurons from ordinary oxidative stresses generated by dopamine and its metabolites and that environmental insults or genetic defects may disrupt this intrinsic capacity of dopaminergic neurons and contribute to their degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
Previous studies showed augmented plasma levels of tHcy in long-term levodopa/DDI-treated patients with Parkinson's disease (PP). 
 Motor fluctuations are the most common complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD).

 This study examines the effect of apomorphine (APO), a nonselective D(1)- and D(2)-dopamine receptor agonist, on the firing activity of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Burst firing is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. 
 We administered 1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1-BnTIQ; 80 mg/kg, i.p.), an endogenous neurotoxin known to cause bradykinesia, the Parkinson's disease-like symptom, in order to obtain biochemical and pathological evidence of behavioral abnormalities. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), the dopamine (DA) neuronal cell death in the nigrostriatal system has been proposed to be mediated by reactive oxygen radicals such as hydroxyl radicals (.OH). 
Her mother had Parkinson's disease with onset at age 70. 
She died at age 74 and the post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of Lewy body positive Parkinson's disease. 
Some other participants thought that the patient had a form of familial Parkinson's disease. 
Although her mother had Lewy body-positive Parkinson's disease, the patient had Lewy body-negative multiple system atrophy with a-synuclein-positive glial inclusions. 
Whether this is just a coincidental occurrence or the presence of a genetic load for Parkinson's disease might triggered her multiple system atrophy is an interesting question to be answered in future. 
 The present study was carried out to test the possible effects of caffeine in improving the memory deficits observed in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrindine (MPTP)-lesioned rats, an animal model of early stage Parkinson's disease. 
These results suggest that the reported dopamine/adenosine-receptor interaction can be used to restore defective learning and memory processes in Parkinson's disease and indicate that caffeine and other adenosine receptor antagonists are drugs with the potential for treatment of the cognitive disabilities of Parkinson's disease. 
In the past, we have intensively studied the effects of estrogen on midbrain dopaminergic neurons which represent the most affected cell population during Parkinson's disease. 
Considering the significance of the D1 dopamine receptor as a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease, this D1 receptor over-expressing model provides an important experimental system to probe the basis for altered behavioral responses following stimulation of transgenetically up-regulated receptors. 
These findings support the early initiation of PPX therapy in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Dopamine receptor agonists are playing an increasingly important role in the treatment of not only patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and those with levodopa-induced motor fluctuations, but also in the early treatment of the disease. 
Several longitudinal studies are currently in progress designed to demonstrate a delay or slowing of progression of Parkinson's disease using various surrogate markers of neuronal degeneration such as 18F-levodopa positron emission tomography and 123I beta-CIT (carbomethoxy-beta-4-iodophenyl-nortropane) single positron emission computed tomography. 
The results of these experimental and clinical studies will improve our understanding of the action of dopamine agonists and provide critical information needed for planning future therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. 
 Abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission at the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) have been implicated in both migraine and Parkinson's disease. 
We have compared the genotype and allele frequencies of the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism in 200 migraineurs and 260 Parkinson's disease cases with 464 controls. 
Our findings do not support the hypothesis that this polymorphism is involved in the aetiology of migraine or Parkinson's disease. 
 The object was to assess alterations in CSF concentrations of monoamine metabolites during withdrawal of medication in patients with Parkinson's disease in relation to the presence or absence of episodes resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). 
This syndrome is a fatal condition developing after neuroleptic therapy, and a neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome (NMLS) may also occur after withdrawal of antiparkinsonian drugs in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Previous biochemical assays showed that the CSF concentration of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) is an independent prognostic factor for development of NMLS in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The study population consisted of nine patients with Parkinson's disease with NMLS and 12 without NMLS, in whom metabolites were assayed during both withdrawal and remedicated periods. 
The present data provide further biochemical evidence for extremely suppressed central dopaminergic activity during NMLS, which may indicate a narrow safety margin for medication withdrawal in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The neuropathology associated with Parkinson's disease within and around the substantia nigra is thought to involve excessive production of free radicals, dopamine autoxidation, defects in the expression of glutathione peroxidase, attenuated levels of reduced glutathione, altered calcium homeostasis, excitotoxicity and genetic defects in mitochondrial complex I activity. 
Unlike idiopathic Parkinson's disease, however, most MPTP models show some degree of behavioral recovery with time. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a preferential loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta.

We used N-(3-iodopropen-2-yl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-chlorophenyl) tropane (IPT) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to determine dopamine transporter function in eight patients with Parkinson's disease Hoehn and Yahr stage I to III over time. 
This technique seems to be a useful tool in monitoring the intra-individual progression of dopaminergic cell loss in patients with Parkinson's disease and may help to follow the effects of putative neuroprotective drugs in future clinical trials. 
 Although it is the treatment of choice in the management of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, l-DOPA (LD) shows a decline in its efficacy after years of prolonged use, with the appearance of severe motor disturbances. 
After a detailed review of the literature reporting psychotogenic effects of apomorphine in patients with Parkinson's disease, an interpretation of these data is difficult, in part because of several confounding factors, such as the concomitant use of drugs known to induce psychosis and the advanced state of the progressive neurological disorder. 
In this report we describe two patients with Parkinson's disease whose speech dysfluency was exacerbated by the administration of levodopa. 
 Experimental evidence suggests that glutamatergic receptor blockade may improve the motor response complications associated with long-term levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

In an open-label prospective study, pergolide was titrated in 16 days to a maximum of 3 mg/d doses as adjunctive treatment to L-Dopa in 10 elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease frequently have depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
At the same time, their Parkinson's disease deteriorated and they initiated self-medication with dopaminergic drugs. 
The most likely explanation for this newly recognized behavioral disorder in patients with Parkinson's disease is enhanced novelty seeking as a consequence of overstimulation of mesolimbic dopamine receptors resulting from addiction to dopaminergic drugs. 
 The objective of the study was to determine the safety and efficacy of increasing doses of Rotigotine CDS in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
The development of motor complications in Parkinson's disease has been linked to intermittent stimulation of dopamine receptors. 
The data suggest that Rotigotine CDS is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease and permits patients to substantially lower L-Dopa doses without loss of antiparkinsonian efficacy. 
In addition to potential therapeutic benefits, this drug can be used to test the hypothesis that continuous dopaminergic stimulation from the initiation of Parkinson's disease therapy will limit the development of motor complications. 
 We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, multiple-dose study on entacapone in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease with levodopa (L-Dopa) treatment-related fluctuations. 
One such dopaminergic tetrahydroisoquinoline neurotoxin is salsolinol (SAL), which is suspected of being associated with the etiology of Parkinson's disease and neuropathology of chronic alcoholism. 
Although psychosis may emerge in the context of any neurologic condition that sufficiently disrupts the functioning of or connections between limbic, paralimbic, frontal, subcortical areas mediating complex sensory perception, interpretation, and thought or language organization, secondary psychoses are most often encountered in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Parkinson's disease receives dopaminomimetic therapies) and epilepsy. 
Although disease-emergent psychosis (paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations) may develop in patients with Parkinson's disease, psychosis due to dopaminomimetic therapy is much more common. 
Similarly, a person who gradually accumulates Cu, will tend to experience a gradual depletion of Zn, with a corresponding increase in oxidative damage, eventually leading to Parkinson's disease. 
 Transplanted human fetal dopamine neurons can reinnervate the striatum in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Vascular Parkinsonism (VP) is characterised by sudden onset and rapid progression of clinical symptoms, absent or poor response to dopamine substitution therapy, and postural instability with shuffling gait and absence of tremor, making it a clinically distinct entity from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). 
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and compare polygraphic sleep measures in those with and without REM sleep disturbances.

 Dopamine agonists provide an effective means of treating early, middle, and late stages of Parkinson's disease. 
 This article reviews the applications of functional neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).

 The aim of this study was to use brain SPECT to differentiate vascular parkinsonism (VP) from Parkinson's disease.METHODS: Fourteen VP patients (age range, 59-87 y; mean age, 70 +/- 7.5 y), 30 Parkinson's disease patients (age range, 54-84 y; mean age, 65 +/- 8.8 y), and 26 healthy (control) individuals (age range, 50-85 y; mean age, 60 +/- 9 y) were examined. 
RESULTS: After a region-of-interest analysis of the images from VP patients, Parkinson's disease patients, and healthy volunteers was performed to obtain ratios of putamen to occipital and striatal to occipital binding as a measurement of specific binding to the dopamine transporters in these regions of the brain, where dopamine neurons are concentrated, the specific binding in the 14 VP patients was slightly lower than but not statistically different from that of the healthy individuals in both putamen and caudate areas. 
A significant decrease in uptake of (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 in the striatum (P<0.01) was found in Parkinson's disease patients. 
Reduction of the uptake was more pronounced in the contralateral putamen of Parkinson's disease patients than that of VP patients (P<0.001). 
A significant bilateral striatal asymmetry was also observed in Parkinson's disease patients but not in VP patients (P< 0.01). 
CONCLUSION: Our findings clearly show that, for VP patients, (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 SPECT is a reliable method to differentiate VP from Parkinson's disease. 
Further studies, including those to differentiate Parkinson's disease from arteriosclerotic parkinsonism and patients with both VP and Parkinson's disease, are needed to help rule out the possibility of Parkinson's disease as early as possible. 
 Several lines of evidence suggest that substitution of the dopaminergic striatal deficit only represents one important aspect of the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) because neurotransmitter systems other than the dopaminergic one also degenerate and aggravate parkinsonian motor, vegetative and cognitive symptoms. 
This study indicates a new source of dopaminergic brain tissue for use as transplants to neurosurgically treat Parkinson's disease patients. 
These results suggest that chronic administration of estrogen may be beneficial in the treatment of female menopausal patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Our results suggest that BDNF may be an important determinant of pathophysiological conditions such as drug addiction, schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease, in which D3 receptor expression is abnormal. 
 Research into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been rapidly advanced by the development of animal models. 
More recently, the identification of alpha-synuclein mutations as a rare cause of Parkinson's disease has led to the development of alpha-synuclein transgenic mice and Drosophila. 
Here, I discuss the merits and limitations of these different animal models in our attempts to understand the physiology of Parkinson's disease and to develop new therapies. 
 Dopamine has been hypothesized as a contributing factor for the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
Our results support a potential role for non-oxidative cytoplasmic dopamine toxicity, and imply that disruption in dopamine disposition and/or metabolism could underlie the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.

 A new therapeutic neurological and neurosurgical methodology involves cell implantation into the living brain in order to replace intrinsic neuronal systems, that do not spontaneously regenerate after injury, such as the dopaminergic (DA) system affected in Parkinson's disease (PD) and aging. 
 The oxidation effects of Mn2+, Mn3+ or MnO2 on dopamine can be studied in vitro and, therefore, this offers a model of the auto-oxidation process that appears naturally in neurons causing Parkinson's disease. 
 Using the rat model of Parkinson's disease described by Ungerstedt the release of [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) in the caudatoputamen was investigated to assess possible long-term effects of unilateral dopaminergic denervation on the modulation of cholinergic interneurons. 
 BACKGROUND: Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). 
OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy. 
The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
These were double-blind, parallel group, multicentre studies including 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. 
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor impairment and disability with an acceptable adverse event profile. 
 BACKGROUND: Long-term levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease is complicated by the development of motor fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of ropinirole versus bromocriptine in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy. 
The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Ropinirole is at least as good as bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor complications in terms of improving off time and reducing levodopa dose, without increasing adverse events including dyskinesia. 
Further, much larger, phase IV studies are required to examine the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of all of the dopamine agonists as adjuvant therapy in Parkinson's disease.

 Changes in dopamine turnover resulting from disease states such as Parkinson's disease may be reflected in corresponding changes in the kinetics of the positron emission tomographic tracer [(18)F]fluorodopa. 
 Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is an established therapeutic strategy for patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study we examined the effects of deep brain stimulation on striatal monoamine metabolism in the intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Several "presynaptic parkinsonian" syndromes, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, are characterised by degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. 
A clinical diagnosis of presynaptic parkinsonism was established in two cases: one case of multiple system atrophy (in this patient loss of dopamine D2 receptors was found with [123I]iodobenzamide SPET performed 2 weeks after [123I]FP-CIT imaging) and one case of Parkinson's disease. 
There is evidence that defective OXPHOS plays an important role in atherogenesis, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and aging. 
 To explore whether dopamine deficits in the globus pallidus have a role in generating the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, we examined the effects of selective intrapallidal administration of dopamine or its antagonists in rats unilaterally lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine into the medial forebrain bundle. 
 In an attempt to find a convenient rat model to study cell vulnerability in Parkinson's disease, we have investigated the cell-loss profile in different midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and subnuclei of rats injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the third ventricle. 
This topographic pattern of degeneration is very similar to that previously described in Parkinson's disease, suggesting that this model may be a useful tool in the study of the cell vulnerability mechanisms in this neurodegenerative disorder. 
Thus, our ability to generate DA neurons from different cell lines, for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, will depend on the identification of appropriate differentiation signals for each cell type under investigation. 
 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a neurotoxin used in the induction of experimental Parkinson's disease in both animals and PC12 cells, which are derived from rat pheochromocytoma tumors and have many properties similar to dopamine neurons. 
 Clozapine is known to be beneficial for the treatment of dopamine agonist-induced psychotic states in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

 Pallidotomy is a neurosurgical procedure designed to ameliorate the akinesia and bradykinesia associated with Parkinson's disease. 
 The aim of this study was to compare two PET ligands, 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-dopa ([(18)F]FDOPA) and (18)F-labeled CFT, 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-[(18)F]-fluorophenyl)tropane ([(18)F]CFT), in detecting presynaptic dopaminergic hypofunction in early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In the present study the involvement of hydroxyl free radicals and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was investigated in the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model of Parkinson's disease. 
 GABA and enkephalin-utilizing efferents from the striatum to the external segment of the pallidal complex (GPe) are thought to be overactive in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The etiology of Parkinson's disease is still unknown, though current investigations support the notion of the pivotal involvement of oxidative stress in the process of neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra (SN). 
In conclusion, our findings suggest that NF-kappaB activation is essential to dopamine-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and it may be involved in nigral neurodegeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 We presented a 60-year-old man with a 12 year history of Parkinson's disease. 
We previously reported that the dopamine agonist ropinirole induced a long-duration response (LDR) in levodopa-naive patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major cause of age-related morbidity and mortality, present in nearly 1% of individuals at ages 70-79 and approximately 2.5% of individuals at age 85. 
 Changes in biochemical status of nerve terminals in the corpus striatum, one of the primary brain regions affected in Parkinson's disease, were studied in groups of C57BL/6 mice treated by ip injection three times over a 2-week period with 3--100 mg/kg heptachlor. 
These results suggest that heptachlor, and perhaps other organochlorine insecticides, exert selective effects on striatal dopaminergic neurons and may play a role in the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that CCK-8 is involved in the regulation of midbrain DA neurotransmission, and thereby implicated in disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, that involve malfunctions of the basal ganglion DA neuronal systems. 
These results suggest that DADLE should be considered as an adjunctive agent for neural transplantation therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 Mutations in alpha-synuclein, a protein highly enriched in presynaptic terminals, have been implicated in the expression of familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) whereas native alpha-synuclein is a major component of intraneuronal inclusion bodies characteristic of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. 
 (R)-apomorphine is a non-selective dopamine (DA) agonist which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The present data are in line with recent studies suggesting a DA receptor-independent neuroprotective effect of apomorphine on DA neurons and call for further studies aimed at evaluating potential neuroprotective effects of apomorphine in Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, there is concern that long-term treatment with levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease might accelerate the rate of degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons. 
Inhibition of dopamine secretion by norsalsolinol may also be involved in postural abnormality in Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in the striatum and extrastriatal region in association with walking exercise in six normal subjects and seven age-matched unmedicated patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The regions of interest method for measuring differences in [11C]CFT uptake level and voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) showed that [11C]CFT uptake in the striatum (specifically the putamen) was decreased by gait to a greater extent in normal subjects, whereas a significant reduction in [11C]CFT uptake was not found in the putamen but in the caudate and orbitofrontal cortex in Parkinson's disease patients. 
Alterations in this availability in Parkinson's disease suggested that shifted activation in the medial striatum and the mesocortical dopaminergic system might reflect the pathophysiology of parkinsonian gait. 
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has already been used in the fields of cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's disease as a potential vector for gene therapy because of its wide host range, high transduction efficiency, and lack of cytopathogenicity. 
Subnormal phenylethylamine levels have been linked to disorders such as attention deficit and depression; the use of selegiline (Deprenyl) in Parkinson's disease may conceivably favour recovery from deficient dopaminergic neurotransmission by a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitory action that increases central phenylethylamine. 
Postmortem neuropathological and clinical genetic studies have generally been disappointing regarding possible relationships of D(4) receptors to the pathophysiology or treatment of schizophrenia, however, they suggest relationships to other neuropsychiatric conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, and Parkinson's disease. 
 A growing body of evidence has implicated oxidative stress as an important factor in the neuropathology associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Alterations in both iron and glutathione levels in the substantia nigra have been correlated with the neuronal degeneration accompanying Parkinson's disease but a direct causative role for either has yet to be definitively proved. 
We will discuss the use of genetically engineered cell and mouse lines generated in our laboratory as models to examine the role that alterations in iron and glutathione levels may play in neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra associated with Parkinson's disease, and how these two parameters may interact with one another to bring this about. 
 Despite the identification of several mutations in familial Parkinson's disease (PD), the underlying mechanisms of dopaminergic neuronal loss in idiopathic PD are still unknown. 
The neuroprotective property of R- and S-APO has been studied in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results suggest that inhibition of FKBP12 rotamase activity is not predictive for neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties of immunophilin ligands and question their therapeutic utility in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. 
in the later stages of Parkinson's disease). 
Given that serotonergic neurons appear to play an important role in the action of L-DOPA in the later stages of Parkinson's disease, strategies targeting the serotonergic system should be considered for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and for combating undesirable side effects of L-DOPA therapy. 
 OBJECTIVE: To learn if Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a restricted attentional "floodlight." BACKGROUND: Different visual tasks may have different attentional requirements. 
 (-)-Deprenyl (DEP) had been shown to slow of progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Human diseases involving its complex circuitry lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). 
CONCLUSION: Using AAV vectors, coexpression of TH and AADC in the striatal cells might be a useful approach to gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

 OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: To compare the safety and efficacy of pramipexole and pergolide in the treatment of mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 BACKGROUND: Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most disturbing and least understood symptom in advanced stage of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Motor fluctuations are a major disabling complication in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
To investigate whether such oscillations in mobility can be attributed to changes in the synaptic levels of dopamine, we studied prospectively patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease with a follow-up after at least 3 years of levodopa treatment. 
Mitigating intracellular dopamine toxicity could be a novel strategy of slowing the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, the data indicate the mechanism of gene regulation for the modified expression of the receptors and could implicate the participation of the receptors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
It has been reported that there may be differences in the binding kinetics of DAT radiotracers to DATs between normal subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Further, DRD2 variants have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in iatrogenically-induced movement disorders, as well as in certain migraineurs. 
 In a randomised double blind parallel-group study in three centers budipine, a diphenylpiperidin derivate, was compared to amantadine with respect to efficacy and safety in the monotherapy of mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Brasofensine (NS-2214) is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor under development by NeuroSearch for the potential treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) [178224]. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative condition of the central nervous system (CNS) that typically presents in the fifth to seventh decade of life, with a movement disorder that consists of a resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. 
Parkinson's disease has been associated frequently with depression, as might be expected from its characteristic dopamine deficient state. 
For perhaps the same reason, the agents that can block re-uptake of dopamine i.e., tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), have been effective in comorborbid depression with Parkinson's disease. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease, who required the initiation of an effective antiparkinsonian treatment, were randomly assigned to receive levodopa, dopamine agonists or deprenyl. 
Dopamine agonists and deprenyl can be considered as an alternative to levodopa for starting treatment in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Tolcapone is a catechol-ortho-methyl-tranferase (COMT) inhibitor that increases the L-DOPA half-life and the duration of effect in Parkinson's disease. 
These results have important implications for estrogen-tamoxifen interactions upon the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and the gender differences which are observed in Parkinson's disease and animal models of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity as well as for the proposed use of tamoxifen in pre-menopausal women at risk for breast cancer. 
 The expression of the human dopamine D(1) receptor was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and radioligand binding using [(3)H]-SCH23390 in post-mortem brain tissue that was obtained from normal subjects and patients dying with Parkinson's disease who were receiving treatment with dopaminergic drugs. 
This study demonstrates that regulation of D(1) receptor expression in the brain of patients dying with Parkinson's disease that were treated with L-DOPA is confined to small alterations in restricted brain regions. 
 OBJECTIVE: In order to find out evidences in explicating whether the transplanted ganglion cells can be kept surviving longer in the brain and to find out an ideal transplantation way for the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: Cervical sympathetic ganglions autotransplantation into the caudate nuclei of the brain in 9 rhesus monkeys known to have the symptoms and signs of the Parkinson's disease beforehand induced by using 1-methy1-4-phen-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropynidne (MPTP) and in addition, muscle tendon tissue was also grafted for comparison. 
It's considered that the sympathetic ganglion is the first choice in comparing with other tissues as the graft for the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
RESULTS: The most frequent parkinsonian syndrome was the defined idiopathic Parkinson's disease with 132 participants (43.7%). 
Probably idiopathic Parkinson's disease was found in 60 cases (19.9%), and possible idiopathic Parkinson's disease in eight cases (2.6%); early onset Parkinson's disease in 10 cases (3.3%), juvenile Parkinson's disease in one case (0.3%), familial Parkinson's disease in five cases (1.7%); cortical Lewy body disease in 16 cases (5.4%), progressive supranuclear palsy in nine cases (3.3%), multiple systemic atrophy in eight cases (2.6%). 
Secondary Parkinson's disease was distributed as follow: vascular disease in 24 cases (8%), local lesion in 11 cases (3%), medications in 16 cases (5.3%), meningoencephalitis in one case (0.3%) and syphilis in one case (0.3%). 
 This study characterizes trigeminal blinks in normal human subjects between 20 and 80 years of age, 60-year-old Parkinson's disease patients, and young and old guinea pigs. 
If normal, age-related loss of dopamine neurons explains these trigeminal blink modifications, then Parkinson's disease should exaggerate age-related changes in these blink parameters. 
Preliminary data show that Parkinson's disease increases blink duration and excitability relative to age-matched control subjects. 
 Partial lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine system can be induced reliably by the intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and are considered to be analogous to the early stages of human Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, this model of uni- and bilateral partial lesions of the nigrostriatal system, as characterized in the present study, may foster further exploration of compensatory functional mechanisms active in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and promote development of novel neuroprotective and restorative strategies. 
 Dopaminergic neurons and their projection-systems are important in some fundamental human activities like locomotion, feeding and sex, essential for survival and procreation, and are relevant to pathologies like Parkinson's disease and drug abuse.

 BACKGROUND: Transplantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease has proved beneficial in open clinical trials. 
METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 patients who were 34 to 75 years of age and had severe Parkinson's disease (mean duration, 14 years) to receive a transplant of nerve cells or sham surgery; all were to be followed in a double-blind manner for one year. 
Among younger patients (60 years old or younger), standardized tests of Parkinson's disease revealed significant improvement in the transplantation group as compared with the sham-surgery group when patients were tested in the morning before receiving medication (P=0.01 for scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; P=0.006 for the Schwab and England score). 
CONCLUSIONS: Human embryonic dopamine-neuron transplants survive in patients with severe Parkinson's disease and result in some clinical benefit in younger but not in older patients. 
 The ability of transplanted neurons from aborted foetuses to produce some therapeutic benefit in Parkinson's disease makes this disease an obvious target for the development of gene therapy procedures which involve delivering the same factors as are provided by the foetal neurons but using a reagent which could be produced in large amounts in a standardised manner. 
Worsening of patients with Parkinson's disease when taking this product has been reported.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by rather selective degeneration of the dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an abnormal degeneration of the dopamine (DA) producing cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmentum area (VTA) in combination with a varying decay of the noradrenergic (locus coeruleus), cholinergic forebrain (nucleus basalis of Meynert) and serotoninergic (dorsal raphe nuclei) systems, leading to a multitude of motor and non-motor behavioral disturbances, known as parkinsonism. 
 Degeneration of the dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the resulting loss of nerve terminals accompanied by DA deficiency in the striatum are responsible for most of the movement disturbances called parkinsonism, observed in Parkinson's disease (PD).

 L-DOPA therapy for Parkinson's disease is one of the major achievements of twentieth century neurology; Parkinson's disease was the first in which specific neurochemical deficits in defined brain regions were identified, and thus for which a rational, chemical therapy could be developed, ushering in the era of clinical neurochemistry. 
Almost completely forgotten, on the other hand, is a paper presented by the Japanese neurologist Isamu Sano in 1960 which reported what is probably the first attempt to treat Parkinson's disease patients with DOPA. 
This is all the more remarkable as the author was also responsible for one of the key papers which led to the use of DOPA in Parkinson's disease by other workers. 
Despite the negative outcome of his experience with L-DOPA, Sano deserves to be remembered as one of the pioneers in catecholamine research, having been the first to map dopamine levels in the human brain, and identified the reduction of dopamine levels in the substantia nigra and striatum in Parkinson's disease.

To determine whether adaptive changes in nigral phospholipid metabolism can occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease we compared activities of 11 catabolic and anabolic enzymes in autopsied brain of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease to those in control subjects. 
Nigral activity of the catabolic enzyme phospholipase A2 was normal in the Parkinson's disease group, whereas that of the biosynthetic enzymes phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, and phosphatidylserine synthase were elevated 193, 48 and 38%, respectively, possibly representing a compensatory response to repair membrane phospholipids. 
Our data indicate that the normally low rate of membrane phospholipid synthesis in the substantia nigra, the primary area of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, is increased during the course of the disorder. 
We suggest that pharmacotherapies which augment this compensatory response might have utility as a treatment for Parkinson's disease.

Preliminary data in Parkinson's disease patients submitted to a subthalamotomy with current functional stereotaxy also indicate that HCB is a very rare complication. 
However, an STN lesion also, simultaneously, further reduces the hypoactivity in the globus pallidus lateralis (GPl) that is a feature of Parkinson's disease, and hence may compensate for GPm hypoactivity, thus self-stabilizing basal ganglia output activity and reducing the risk of HCB. 
We conclude that lesioning of the STN in Parkinson's disease is a feasible approach in some circumstances.

 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), via its major metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)), produces in primates including humans clinical, biochemical, and neuropathological changes similar to those which occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Here we show that Ebselen, when administered before, during, and after MPTP injections, prevents both neuronal loss and clinical symptoms in a primate MPTP model of Parkinson's disease. 
Our results demonstrate that compounds which prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical production may be useful as preventive treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Seven de novo patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied twice, before and after three months of levodopa medication. 
 Riluzole is neuroprotective in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and may also protect dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
These results provide further impetus to explore the neuroprotective potential of riluzole in Parkinson's disease. 
 Intrastriatal transplantation of dopaminergic neurones aims to repair the selective loss of nigrostriatal projections and the consequent dysfunction of striatocortical circuitries in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Hydroxyl free radical production seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. 
 Alpha-Dihydroergocryptine (alpha-DHEC), a Dopamine (DA) D2 receptor agonist, is widely used as dopaminergic drug in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 A patient with severe Parkinson's disease presented with increasing dyspnea, bilateral pleural effusion and peripheral edema that were refractory to diuretic therapy and were first misdiagnosed as signs of right-sided heart failure. 
 This study was designed to elucidate the mechanism to develop levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
For this purpose, we administered methyl levodopa repeatedly to a rat model of Parkinson's disease with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced lesion of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway. 
 The dopamine D2 receptor (D2) system has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
Extracellular recordings and rotational behaviour were employed to obtain a correlate to these findings in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is a major neurological disorder that primarily affects the nigral dopaminergic cells. 
Nigral histamine innervation is altered in human postmortem Parkinson's disease brains. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate possible changes in the H3 receptor system in a well-characterized model of Parkinson's disease--the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. 
 Ropinirole is a selective non-ergoline dopamine D2 receptor agonist indicated for use in treating Parkinson's disease. 
Population pharmacokinetics have demonstrated that gender, mild or moderate renal impairment, Parkinson's disease stage and concomitant illnesses or the use of several common concomitant medications have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole. 
 The effects of current neurosurgical interventions for levodopa-induced dyskiensias (DID) in Parkinson's disease are reviewed. 
 Stereotactic surgery and neuronal transplantation are considered to be effective surgical therapies for advanced Parkinson's disease with wearing off phenomenon. 
 Tremor is the most common initial symptom and one of the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease. 
 The purpose of the new drugs for Parkinson's disease is control of the long-term levodopa treatment syndromes, especially wearing-off phenomenon and dyskinesia. 
 In Parkinson's disease(PD) cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolic rate measurements using SPECT and PET have demonstrated functional abnormality in basal ganglia-thalamocortical and its related circuits. 
 During the last half of the 20th century, medical treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) showed remarkable progresses, resulting in marked prolongation of life and self-dependency of patients. 
 Dopamine may contribute to the loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease by generating reactive oxygen species and quinones. 
As oxidative stress is thought to play an active role in the pathobiology of Parkinson's disease, these data may be relevant to our understanding of the disorder. 
In Parkinson's disease, NMDA receptor antagonists could be beneficial by enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA at the level of the striatum. 
The magnitude of mean postural dorsiflexion torque in the rise-to-toes task was highly correlated with a clinical rating scale of gait and balance, suggesting that force control is a critical factor influencing postural control in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene have been identified in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). 
It is due to the CAE effect that a) the maintenance of rats on (-)deprenyl during the postdevelopmental phase of their life slows the age-related decline of sexual and learning performances and prolongs life significantly; b) patients with early, untreated Parkinson's disease maintained on (-)deprenyl need levodopa significantly later than their placebo-treated peers, and when on levodopa plus (-)deprenyl, they live significantly longer than patients on levodopa alone; and c) in patients with moderately severe impairment from Alzheimer's disease, treatment with (-)deprenyl slows the progression of the disease. 
It is reasonable to expect that a prophylactic low dose administration of a safe catecholaminergic activity enhancer substance during the postdevelopmental phase of life will slow the age-related decline of behavioral performances, delay natural death and decrease susceptibility to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
This finding may be important clinically with regards to the treatment of many neuropsychiatric disorders and in the pathophysiology of various human disorders including estrogen-induced cancers, Parkinson's disease, depression and hypertension. 
 The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) has been used extensively in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
Its efficacy and safety in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease has been investigated in several clinical studies. 
In addition to its likely usefulness in the treatment of rest tremor in Parkinson's disease, data suggest that pramipexole is of interest due to its reported low frequency of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side-effects. 
However, studies comparing pramipexole with other antiparkinsonian agents would be useful to further define its benefits in the treatment of tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and to further document its favourable adverse event profile. 
 This paper reviews the preclinical study of the novel dopamine agonist pramipexole and its use in early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The conventional dopamine agonists are ergot-derived compounds that are most widely used as adjunctive therapies in advancing Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine receptor agonists are assuming increased importance in the treatment of both early and advanced symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Chronic L-dopa therapy is associated with the development of motor complications in the majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 Intermittent or pulsatile dopamine-receptor stimulation is postulated to induce plastic changes in motor systems that are responsible for the development of the motor fluctuations and dyskinesia that complicate long-term L-dopa therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Open clinical trials support the value of continuous dopaminergic stimulation in Parkinson's disease with established motor complications, but rigorous studies, although experimentally difficult, are needed. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor complications show a greater reduction in putamen [18F]dopa uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) compared with sustained responders to L-dopa, although individual ranges overlap considerably. 
 Characteristic changes involving interactions between dopamine and glutamate in striatal medium spiny neurons now appear to contribute to symptom production in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This switch is suggested to underlie dopamine-agonist-induced dyskinetic movements that develop during the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms originate from the loss of the dopaminergic control of neuronal activity in the striatum. 
Intrastriatal dopaminergic neurons increase substantially in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
In order to evaluate its usefulness we conducted an open label, prospective and longitudinal study in 26 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on chronic levodopa therapy who presented peaks of dose dyskinesias. 
In contrast, neuromelanin (NM) is found in deep brain regions, specifically in loci that degenerate in Parkinson's disease. 
Although this distribution suggests a role for NM in Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration, the biosynthesis and function of NM have eluded characterization because of lack of an experimental system. 
 The putamen of the human striatum is a heterogeneous nucleus that contains the primary site of loss of dopamine (DA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Restoration of impulse flow in the septohippocampal GABA pathway, possibly via M(3) receptor agonists, may, therefore, be critical for successful treatment of cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. 
 We investigated the prevalence of dyskinesias and motor fluctuations, and the factors determining their occurrence, in a community-based population of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Among 124 patients with Parkinson's disease, 87 (70%) had received a levodopa preparation. 
However, poorer quality of life associated with inadequate dosage of levodopa may be the price for a low rate of motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The dopamine receptor agonist ropinirole (SKF-101468) is used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore ropinirole and its primary metabolites, SKF-104557, SKF-97930 and SKF-96990, and the rat metabolite, SKF-89124 were tested in the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of Parkinson's disease. 
Primary metabolites of ropinirole did not contribute significantly to its activity in this model of Parkinson's disease. 
In addition, nicotinic receptors with high affinity for agonists have generally been found to be reduced in the striatum in Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study antibodies have been used to examine which subunits contribute to the striatal nicotinic receptor loss in Parkinson's disease, and whether the reduction in [(3)H]nicotine binding correlates with synaptic loss. 
Autopsy tissue from the putamen of 12 Parkinson's disease cases and 12 age-matched control subjects was analysed by immunoblotting using antibodies against recombinant peptides specific for alpha3, alpha4, alpha7, beta2 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits and the synaptic marker synaptophysin, in conjunction with assessment of [(3)H]nicotine binding by autoradiography. 
The data indicate that there is no loss of alpha3, alpha4, alpha7 and beta2 immunoreactivity in the putamen in Parkinson's disease, despite a highly significant reduction in [(3)H]nicotine binding. 
Synaptophysin immunoreactivities were also similar in Parkinson's disease and control cases. 
These results suggest that the loss of nicotine binding in the putamen in Parkinson's disease may involve an nAChR subunit (e.g., alpha5 and/or alpha6) other than those investigated. 
 Early and correct diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) are crucial for the patient's well being. 
 Immediate behavioral and biochemical effects of single doses of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ, 50 mg/kg) and salsolinol (100 mg/kg), suspected of involvement in etiology of Parkinson's disease, were investigated. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by a loss of dopaminergic neurones in the basal ganglia. 
 A characteristic change in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients is an apparent accelerated rate of dopamine oxidation as evidenced by an increased 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (5-S-CyS-DA) to dopamine ratio. 
Such changes together with evidence for accelerated dopamine oxidation, increased formation of 5-S-CyS-DA and the ease of oxidation of this conjugate to DHBT-1 which inhibits alpha-KGDH and complex I, without affecting other respiratory enzyme complexes, suggests that the latter putative metabolite might be an endotoxin that contributes to the alpha-KGDH and complex I defects in Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, these findings provide further support for neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway that occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
The maintained inhibitory function of A2A R on motor activity in spite of dopamine depletion could be partly responsible for the depression of locomotor activity observed in basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
 In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the prototypical metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu(5)) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) on motor behaviour in rats using the accelerating rotarod, spontaneous locomotor activity and the 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model to assess its treatment potential for Parkinson's disease. 
In view of these findings, it could be concluded that MPEP and potentially other mGlu(5) receptor antagonists are probably not appropriate drug candidates for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Since selective adenosine A(2A) antagonists have been proposed as adjuncts to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy in Parkinson's disease we wanted to examine if tolerance also develops to the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist 5-amino-7-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2, 4-triazolo [1,5-c]pyrimidine (SCH 58261). 
This reduction in uptake was even more severe than that of patients with Parkinson's disease, and indicated that the dopamine function was markedly impaired in the left nigrostriatal system. 
 Oxidative stress has been implicated in the selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The dopaminergic system is implicated in disorders such as Parkinson's disease and addiction, and is the major target for antipsychotic medication in the treatment of schizophrenia. 
In this animal model of Parkinson's disease, density of binding in caudate-putamen increased at KA, but not NMDA or AMPA receptors. 
The findings indicate that nigrostriatal dopamine denervation can selectively enhance KA receptor levels in rat basal ganglia, suggest that KA receptors contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, and may suggest innovative treatments. 
 OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency and severity of acute orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Parkinson's disease who are starting dopamine agonist therapy. 
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the context of an outpatient clinical practice, 29 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease who were starting dopamine agonist therapy were brought into the clinic for their first dose of agonist. 
CONCLUSIONS: Acute OH occurs frequently when starting dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease, but is frequently not appreciated by patients. 
These results provide novel information on the mechanisms underlying L-DOPA's action in the cerebral cortex, striatum and external pallidum in a primate model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The aim of current treatment of Parkinson's disease is to ameliorate the symptoms while seeking to lessen the potential development of late levodopa complications. 
However levodopa remains the treatment of choice in Parkinson's disease and should not be restricted unnecessarily in patients with disability. 
There is no evidence that levodopa is toxic to dopaminergic neurons in people with Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of water soluble prodrugs of L-dopa via the nasal route in the treatment of Parkinson's disease may have therapeutic advantages such as improved bioavailability, decreased side effects, and potentially enhanced CNS delivery. 
 The pathophysiology of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LID), a common problem after long-term use of L-dopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), is not completely understood. 
Amantadine was approved for treatment of Parkinson's disease in 1975, and for the influenza A virus infection in November 1998, in Japan. 
All of these 8 nursing homes used amantadine for Parkinson's disease, but only half of them used the drug for influenza A infection. 
This is the first report that the resistant influenza viruses already exist in nursing facilities where amantadine was used for not only influenza but also Parkinson's disease in Japan. 
 Studies of dopamine (DA) receptor binding in early parkinsonian patients, or in models of Parkinson's disease, have revealed a supersensitivity of the D2-like receptor subtype as compared to age-matched controls. 
To determine if this phenomenon generalizes to other motor behaviors, we have used this rat model of Parkinson's disease to examine the effects of the direct dopamine D(1) receptor agonist SKF 82958 and the indirect DA agonist L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) on the acoustic startle response. 
GOAL: To understand the impact that Parkinson's disease has on patients and to identify areas of drug therapy that can be optimized to improve a patient's quality of life. 
Discuss the epidemiology and pathophysiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). 
Identify the appropriate use, common adverse effects, and drug interactions of dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors in Parkinson's disease therapy. 
 Neuromelanin is a dark brown pigment suspected of being involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
In this study we used such a procedure to extract the neuromelanin pigment from a pool of substantia nigra from patients affected by Parkinson's disease. 
These results are consistent with the view that oxidative stress has a relevant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias constitute a challenge to the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. 
 Mutations in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) genes may be of interest in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) because of the important role these enzymes play in retinoid and dopamine metabolism and/or aldehyde detoxification. 
 Dopamine receptor agonists provide symptomatic relief in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, but with disease progression, their efficacy decreases. 
 Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. 
Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use. 
 Levodopa is still the most effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Levodopa combined with a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI) has been considered the therapy of choice for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Much has been written about the pharmacologic management of Parkinson's disease (PD) because of an expanding arsenal of antiparkinson drugs and our quest to alter the natural history of disease. 
In addition, our findings may provide insight into symptoms of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease; the dysfunction of D1-dopamine receptors in the PMd1 and PMd may contribute to some symptoms, such as bradyphrenia and bradykinesia, in these disorders. 
Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Prevalence of sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness have been shown to be increased in Parkinson's disease. 
Because loss of nigrostriatal neurons is a central feature of Parkinson's disease and evidence suggests that nicotinic agonists potentiate antiparkinsonian effects of L-dopa, experiments were done to determine whether nicotinic receptor subunit messenger RNAs and binding sites were altered in the basal ganglia after nigrostriatal degeneration. 
By the anti-apoptotic function, rasagiline may rescue or protect declining neurons in aging and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 A massive degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) in the midbrain is characteristic of Parkinson's disease. 
In addition, the inflammation-mediated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the rat SN resulting from the targeted injection of LPS may serve as a useful model to gain further insights into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 The etiology of Parkinson's disease is not known. 
If an inflammatory response is involved in Parkinson's disease, it would be logical to consider antioxidants and the newly developed, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs such as cyclo-oxygenase (COX2) inhibitors as a form of treatment. 
However, to date there has been little or no success in the clinical treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (for example, Parkinson's disease, ischaemia etc.) where neurons die, while in animal models the same drugs provide neuroprotection. 
Thus, consideration should be given to multi-neuroprotective drug therapy in Parkinson's disease, similar to the approach taken in AIDS and cancer therapy. 
 In the last few years, the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease has gained major attention and resulted in the identification of four gene loci in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. 
Several mutations in two genes have been shown to be responsible for neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
One of the gene products involved, alpha-synuclein, is a major component of Lewy bodies, the neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease. 
The increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease at a molecular level will have important implications for the development of individual therapeutic strategies to prevent disease progression. 
 Levodopa-induced dyskinesia is a major therapeutic problem in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The mechanisms underlying the manifestations and the priming process for dyskinesia remain unknown, but non-dopaminergic approaches to therapy may provide an effective way of preventing, or limiting, the expression of involuntary movements in Parkinson's disease. 
These striatal changes contribute to symptom production in Parkinson's disease, and their prevention or reversal could prove useful in the treatment of this disorder. 
 Parkinson's disease no longer seems to be a disease entity caused by only one pathogenetic factor. 
The facile characterization of Parkinson's disease as a more or less isolated disorder of the dopaminergic system proves to be an unacceptable oversimplification of the pathology of the disease. 
An open, prospective, long-term study of 2532 patients with Parkinson's disease (Study BY701/01A) confirmed the favorable safety and tolerability profiles of budipine. 
 This paper reviews the relative abilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect Parkinson's disease and monitor its progression. 
Currently, the main role of MRI lies in its ability to discriminate atypical syndromes from Parkinson's disease; however, new volumetric approaches may soon allow progression of nigral degeneration to be followed. 
 Genetic polymorphisms of dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) may be susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease due to their influence on dopamine response and association with cigarette smoking, which is inversely related to risk of Parkinson's disease. 
Relations of TaqIA and TaqIB DRD2 genotypes with Parkinson's disease were investigated and tested for interactive effects with smoking and the monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) intron 13 polymorphism previously found to be related to smoking. 
Study subjects were 152 cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 231 controls. 
Neither TaqIA or TaqIB genotypes modified the inverse relation of smoking and Parkinson's disease. 
When genotypes for DRD2 were considered in combination with genotypes for intron 13 of MAO-B, genotype combinations with high risk of Parkinson's disease were found; although the MAO-B/DRD2 interaction did not reach statistical significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, these results are suggestive of a possible synergism between MAOB and DRD2 genes with respect to Parkinson's disease. 
In this review we have focused on the application of ex vivo gene therapy techniques in Parkinson's disease models, however, the issues and approaches are applicable to other neurodegenerative disorders. 
We describe different vector systems that are currently available and review the various cell types that have been genetically modified and grafting into the striatum of animal models with experimental Parkinson's disease. 
The strategies for application of gene therapy techniques to the treatment for Parkinson's disease have expanded beyond the classical dopamine replacement toward the use of neurotrophic factors in enhancing cell function or preventing cell death. 
In addition, we explore the utility of autologus primary skin fibroblasts as alternative cell type for ex vivo gene therapy in the animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
These results have general implications for the application of ex vivo gene therapy to human neurological diseases and specific implications for Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with clinical features resulting from deficiency of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system. 
The association of a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism in the DAT gene with Parkinson's disease (PD) in a Korean population was studied. 
 Degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is the major pathogenic substrate of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
CASE SUMMARY: A 75-year-old critically ill white man who was receiving selegiline 5 mg twice daily for Parkinson's disease was initiated on an intravenous dopamine infusion for decreased urine output and hypotension. 
Strategies to increase this survival are critical to the future of transplantation for Parkinson's disease. 
 Bromocriptine is applied for treatment of patients with hyperprolactinaemic disorders, Parkinson's disease and acromegaly. 
In the brain, where coexpression of functionally distinct receptors in heterogeneous cells further adds to the complexity of dopamine signaling, minor alterations in receptor/G protein coupling states during either development or in adults, may underlie the imbalanced signaling seen in dopaminergic-linked diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
 Dopamine-derived 6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3', 4'-dihydroxybenzyl)-isoquinolines, papaverolines and tetrahydropapaverolines, have been proposed to be neurotoxin candidates related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Administered intraperitoneally, they both potentiated the activity of L-DOPA in the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned (6-OHDA) rat, a model of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, our findings are of interest in relation of degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway that occurs in Parkinson's disease  Studies with cerebrospinal fluid from subjects with Parkinson's disease suggest that purine abnormalities may be present in this disorder. 
 Recent pathophysiological models of basal ganglia function in Parkinson's disease predict that specific neurochemical changes in the indirect pathway would follow the lack of stimulation of D(2) dopamine receptors. 
To date, the most successful grafts have been obtained in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Pig embryonic neural tissue has been grafted to patients with Parkinson's disease, but no functional benefits have clinically been proven so far. 
 Although several adaptive mechanisms have been identified that mask the existence of Parkinson's disease and delay the onset and aggravation of motor symptoms, the timescale and implications of this compensatory process remain an enigma. 
 Levodopa-induced dyskinesias represent a major shortcoming of Parkinson's disease management, and its pharmacological treatment is generally unsatisfactory. 
These results suggest that in the presence of a Complex I defect, misregulation of DA storage could lead to the loss of nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
Behavioural and morphological evidence in the present study indicate a potential antiparkinsonian and neuroprotective role for modafinil, which may form a new pharmacological approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine-replacement strategies form the basis of most symptomatic treatments for Parkinson's disease. 
However, since long-term dopamine-replacement therapies are characterized by many side effects, most notably dyskinesia, the concept of a nondopaminergic therapy for Parkinson's disease has attracted great interest. 
In animal models of Parkinson's disease, loss of striatal dopamine leads to enhanced excitation of striatal NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. 
The present study was designed to explore the possibility of HAE cells to serve as a donor for transplantation therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others. 
We examined the effects of aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen on cultured primary rat embryonic neurons from mesencephalon, the area primarily affected in Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, NSAIDs protected neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity in vitro, and deserve further consideration as neuroprotective agents in Parkinson's disease. 
That some of these neurodegenerative syndromes-such as Parkinson's disease-are already common only heightens the need for insight in the face of a population with increasing expectations of longevity. 
The realisation that some forms of Parkinson's disease have a genetic determinant is gaining strength. 
 After 3-5 years of continuous use of 1-dopa preparations for Parkinson's disease, 25%-50% of patients develop side-effects such as the "on-off" phenomenon and involuntary movements that markedly impair function. 
 The main metabolic pathway affected in Parkinson's disease is that of dopamine oxidation and melanin formation in substantia nigra which involves both oxidative and reductive enzymes. 
We, therefore, recorded SEPs in nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and in seven psychotic patients affected by neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), all showing severe rigidity. 
The profile of these drug-induced nigrostriatal dopamine system deficits resembles aspects of Parkinson's disease pathology and, as such, may provide a useful model with which to evaluate neuroprotective and neurorestorative strategies. 
 RATIONALE: Some features of Parkinson's disease are exacerbated by stress and anxiety and it is important to understand the effects of dopamine receptor agonists on measures of anxiety. 
 The authors compared efficacy and safety of risperidone and clozapine for the treatment of psychosis in a double-blind trial with 10 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) and psychosis. 
 The underlying cause of the selective death of the nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is not fully understood. 
The data presented herein suggest a possible role for P450 involvement in membrane and receptor regulation via epoxyeicosatrienoic acid formation and a potential involvement of P450 in the oxidation of dopamine to reactive oxygen species under aberrant physiological conditions where the sequestering of dopamine becomes compromised, such as in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurological disease suited to gene therapy, is biochemically characterized by a severe decrease in the dopamine content of the striatum. 
 Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, is commonly used in combination with levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In Parkinson's disease, together with the classic loss of dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, neuropathological studies and biochemical findings documented the occurrence of a concomitant significant cell death in the locus coeruleus. 
This review analyzes the latest data obtained from experimental parkinsonism indicating that, the loss of norepinephrine in Parkinson's disease might worsen the dopamine nigrostriatal damage. 
Within this latter context, basic research provided a new provocative hypothesis on the significance of locus coeruleus in conditioning the natural history of Parkinson's disease. 
This form of synaptic plasticity may therefore be important for understanding disturbances of the motor system seen in humans with Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common motor disorder affecting the elderly. 
 Performance on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST) of patients with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) was simulated by a neural network model constructed on principles derived from neuroanatomic loops from the frontal cortex through the basal ganglia and thalamus. 
 The absence of any compelling basis for a heritable basis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) has focused attention on environmental exposures as causative agents. 
Ropinirole is indicated as adjunct therapy to levodopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
It is also indicated, and recent clinical trials have focused on its use, as monotherapy in patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
In the symptomatic treatment of early Parkinson's disease ropinirole monotherapy was significantly more effective than placebo in 2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind trials of 3 to 12 months duration as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and Clinical Global Impression/Clinical Global Evaluation Scales. 
As an adjunct therapy to levodopa in patients with more advanced Parkinson's disease, ropinirole was reported to be as effective as bromocriptine and significantly more effective than placebo. 
In patients with early Parkinson's disease, ropinirole generally showed a similar overall tolerability profile to bromocriptine although, over a 3-year period nausea was more commonly reported with ropinirole recipients. 
Prior to the addition of supplementary levodopa 5% of ropinirole recipients had experienced dyskinesia compared with 36% of those receiving levodopa.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early Parkinson's disease, ropinirole monotherapy was more efficacious than bromocriptine with regard to improvement in activities of daily living, and need for supplemental levodopa. 
Thus available data suggest that ropinirole may provide a means of treating early Parkinson's disease while minimising the risk of dyskinesia and delaying the need for supplemental levodopa in some patients. 
In addition, ropinirole is also efficacious in the management of more advanced Parkinson's disease in patients who are experiencing motor complications after long term levodopa use. 
 The variability in clinical features and the masking effects of drug therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) can affect clinical assessment of disease severity. 
 BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the use of dopamine receptor agonists in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease because of concern about a high rate of intolerable side effects. 
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was used to examine our experience with dopamine agonist use in the very elderly by identifying patients in our Parkinson's disease database who were over the age of 80 years and who had received agonists. 
 Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Surgical ablation for Parkinson's disease was abandoned in the 1970s after successful clinical trials of L-DOPA and L-DOPA/decarboxylase inhibitor combinations and early dopamine receptor agonists were added to prolong a viable therapeutic window beyond 5 years. 
 Neuronal injury has been consistently found in A10 midbrain dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Along with dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with subtle but widespread cognitive impairment even in the absence of clinically apparent cognitive decline. 
In Parkinson's disease, degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system leads to overactivity of the 'indirect' striatopallidal projection to the lateral (external) segment of the globus pallidus. 
 The usefulness of an initial treatment of Parkinson's disease with a dopamine agonist has now been studied for more than 20 years. 
 Dopamine D3 receptors may be involved in drug addiction and in disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
These consequences might include increased susceptibility to drug addiction, seizures, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, etc. 
 In Parkinson's disease a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway is observed. 
This indicates that absence of dopamine in Parkinson's disease might principally affect D2R-mediated effects with regard to locomotor functions. 
A2AR-selective antagonists have been demonstrated to have anti- parkinsonian activities in various models of Parkinson's disease in rodents and nonhuman primates. 
 OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant pramipexole therapy versus inactive placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa. 
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of pramipexole versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy. 
The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of drop outs and adverse events. 
MAIN RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials have compared pramipexole with placebo in 669 patients with later Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Drugs that mimic dopamine as bromocriptine were introduced as monotherapy or in a combination with LD in the hope that this approach would prevent or delay the onset of motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of bromocriptine (BR) monotherapy for delaying the onset of motor complications associated with levodopa (LD) therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Nevertheless, based on qualitative review of available data we conclude that in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease, bromocriptine may be beneficial in delaying motor complications and dyskinesias with comparable effects on impairment and disability in those patients that tolerate the drug. 
 BACKGROUND: Long-term levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease is complicated by the development of motor fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements. 
OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant ropinirole therapy with bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease already established on levodopa therapy and suffering from motor complications. 
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of ropinirole versus bromocriptine in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy. 
The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Ropinirole is at least as good as bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease with motor complications in terms of improving off time and reducing levodopa dose, without increasing adverse events including dyskinesia. 
Further, much larger, phase IV studies are required to examine the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of all of the dopamine agonists as adjuvant therapy in Parkinson's disease.

 In thirty patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) we examined in a prospectively designed study the effect on motor performance and cognitive functions of amantadine sulphate, applied intravenously over a period of 14 days. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by pathological changes which include degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta coupled with intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies. 
Tolcapone was the first COMT inhibitor available for use as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Both are used, often simultaneously, as adjuncts to L-dopa/dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Transdermal administration of dopamine agonists such as piribedil may provide a useful means of producing a long-lasting reversal of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease while avoiding acute adverse effects such as nausea. 
Given the widespread use of these compounds in the environment such studies may also provide clues to the process of nigrostriatal cell degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
This attenuation is regarded as a beneficial effect of the muscarinic antagonists as adjuncts to L-dopa in Parkinson's disease treatment. 
Both entacapone and tolcapone enhance and extend the therapeutic effect of levodopa in patients with advanced and fluctuating Parkinson's disease. 
Tolcapone also appears to have a beneficial effect in patients with nonfluctuating Parkinson's disease. 
They provide a new treatment possibility in patients with Parkinson's disease who have problems with their present levodopa therapy. 
In light of this, the dopamine transporter may prove useful, both as a marker for susceptibility to Parkinson's disease and as a target for therapeutic intervention. 
Clinically, levodopa and pergolide improved motor Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores at 6 months but only levodopa maintained benefit at 12 months as compared to baseline. 
Her doctor initially diagnosed Parkinson's disease and administered amantadine and levodopa. 
Based on the present results clinicians should be aware of the potential of worsened orthostatic hypotension when prescribing levodopa to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 Grafting of ventral mesencephalic tissue in Parkinson's disease results in a partial dopaminergic reinnervation of host brain and dopamine agonist-induced rotational behavior is not completely reversed. 
 Major practical constraints on neural grafting in Parkinson's disease are the shortage of human donor tissue and the great loss of dopamine neurons during the grafting procedure. 
 Transplantation of embryonic nigral tissue is used as an experimental therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease but is hampered by a limited survival rate of dopaminergic neurons. 
 Using an approach that combines gene therapy with aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) gene and a pro-drug (l-dopa), dopamine, the neurotransmitter involved in Parkinson's disease, can be synthesized and regulated. 
This approach to treating Parkinson's disease may reduce the need for l-dopa/carbidopa, thus providing a better clinical response with fewer side effects. 
The high density of CB1 cannabinoid receptors within the basal ganglia suggests a potential role for endocannabinoids in the control of voluntary movement and in basal ganglia-related movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
In the reserpine-treated rat, an animal model of Parkinson's disease, suppression of locomotion is accompanied by a sevenfold increase in the levels of the 2AG in the globus pallidus, but not in the other five brain regions analyzed. 
These findings indicate a link between endocannabinoid signaling in the globus pallidus and symptoms of Parkinson's disease in the reserpine-treated rat, and suggest that modulation of the endocannabinoid signaling system might prove useful in treating this or other basal ganglia-related movement disorders. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
Oxidative stress appears to be elevated in the normal human substantia nigra in comparison with other brain regions, and further increases occur in Parkinson's disease. 
Ninety-eight individuals were investigated: 11 healthy volunteers, 58 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and 29 patients with symptomatic parkinsonism (SPD). 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that manifests clinically with variable degrees of tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. 
Tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease is characterised by prominent tremor of one or more limbs with a relative lack of significant rigidity and bradykinesia. 
Despite the lack of other disabling motor symptoms, the tremor of tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease can be very disabling, especially if a postural and kinetic component exists. 
A wide variety of treatments for Parkinson's disease tremor are currently available and include use of oral medications, injections with botulinum toxin and neurosurgical procedures. 
However, some patients with Parkinson's disease tremors are unresponsive to first line drugs and treatment with second line medications (clozapine, amantadine, clonazepam, propranolol, neurontin) should be attempted. 
 OBJECTIVE: To use pharmacostatistical models to evaluate the overall exposure of patients with Parkinson's disease to levodopa in the presence and absence of tolcapone. 
METHODS: Four hundred twelve patients with Parkinson's disease with fluctuating and nonfluctuating responses to levodopa participated in three multicentered, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding studies and received either placebo or tolcapone in addition to levodopa-decarboxylase inhibitor therapy. 
The caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei are the major thalamic regulators of the caudate nucleus and putamen, areas known to be dysfunctional in progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease. 
Despite different thalamic pathology, there was a dramatic reduction in the total neuronal number in the caudal intralaminar nuclei in both progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease (40-55% loss). 
In Parkinson's disease, Lewy bodies were found in these regions, while in progressive supranuclear palsy abundant intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and glial tangles concentrated in the caudal intralaminar nuclei. 
The caudal intralaminar thalamus appears to be one of three basal ganglia sites commonly affected in both progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease. 
For patients with Parkinson's disease, this loss of glutamate regulation may help explain some problems with dopamine replacement therapies, particularly over time. 
 We investigated the role of dopamine neurons in the manifestation of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus nitroglycerin might be of use in Parkinson's disease. 
These results may be of relevance to the L-DOPA long-term therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 The loss of dopaminergic innervation of the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical regions involved in motor control, is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease. 
These data demonstrate regionally specific alterations in behavioral and cellular responses to a serotonergic agonist in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The etiology of Parkinson's disease is not known. 
If an inflammatory response is involved in Parkinson's disease it would be logical to consider antioxidants and the newly developed non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs such as COX2 (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibitors as a form of treatment. 
However to date there has been little or no success in the clinical treatment of neurodegenerative diseases per se (Parkinson's disease, ischemia etc.), where neurons die, while in animal models the same drugs produce neuroprotection. 
Thus, consideration should be given to multi-neuroprotective drug therapy in Parkinson's disease, similar to the approach taken in AIDS and cancer therapy. 
 l-Deprenyl (Selegiline), a selective and irreversible type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor, has been used as an adjunct to levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons, which leads to overactivity of the surviving DA neurons and an increase in neurotransmitter release and turnover. 
It remains an open question to what extent the mitochondrial damage seen in Parkinson's disease is of genetic origin and how much is caused by H2O2 generated during enhanced turnover of DA, especially during treatment with L-dopa. 
In addition, right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease with higher right than left caudate K(i) performed much better in bimanual movement tests than those in whom the K(i) value of the left caudate was higher than that of the right. 
OBJECTIVES: To determine demographic changes and referral patterns observed in a hospital-based monographic outpatient clinic on Parkinson's disease and movement disorders along an eight-year period (1991-1998). 
CONCLUSIONS: Demographics features of patients attending a Parkinson's disease and movement disorder unit are submitted to changes over time. 
Previous findings as to whether these receptors are changed in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are inconsistent and no previous investigations have focused on these receptors in dementia with Lewy bodies and schizophrenia, which are also associated with disorders of movement. 
The present autoradiographic study of striatal [3H]nicotine binding in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, dementia with Lewy bodies and schizophrenia was conducted with particular reference to the potentially confounding variables of tobacco use and neuroleptic medication. 
[3H]Nicotine binding in both dorsal and ventral caudate and putamen was significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease (43-67%, n=13), Alzheimer's disease (29-37%, n=13) and dementia with Lewy bodies (50-61%, n=20) compared to age-matched controls (n=42). 
 Dyskinesias are abnormal involuntary movements which develop as a side-effect of long-term treatment with levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Non-dopaminergic therapies are of potential interest in the treatment of Parkinson's disease given the complications associated with current dopamine-replacement therapies. 
In this study we demonstrate that SB 206553 (5-methyl-1-(3-pyridylcarbamoyl)-1,2,3, 5-tetrahydropyrrol[2,3-f]indole) (20 mg/kg) enhanced the actions of the dopamine D(1) receptor agonist, SKF 82958 ((+)-6-chloro-7, 8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide) (1 mg/kg), in eliciting locomotion in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
5-HT(2C) receptor antagonists may have potential as a means of reducing reliance on dopamine replacement in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The study is based on recent findings that methylation may play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in the actions of L-dopa. 
This report focuses on the structural (i.e., the ability to produce consistent binding estimates) validity of 4 methods to quantify striatal binding potential (BP) for IACFT.METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers and 8 patients with Parkinson's disease were subjects for this study. 
 D(3) receptors are prominently localized in the primate caudate-putamen, and D(3) receptor agonist properties may offer an advantage in Parkinson's disease therapy. 
Since complex I dysfunction is reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, DOPAL potentiation of the deleterious effects of complex I inhibition may contribute to the specific vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to injury. 
 Two patients with Parkinson's disease received treatment with ropinirole and/or pramipexole, during which both experienced sleep attacks. 
 We studied the rate of progression of striatal dopamine transporter function in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Therefore, these cells may prove as a drug-delivery system for the treatment of neurological degenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We compared serum levels of coenzyme Q10 and the coenzyme Q10/cholesterol ratio in 33 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 31 matched controls. 
 Considerable evidence suggests that some visual abnormalities in Parkinson's disease are mediated by disruption of dopaminergic processes in the retina. 
In Parkinson's disease, the apparent contrast of peripherally viewed medium and high spatial frequency gratings is reduced. 
 R-apomorphine is a mixed dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptor agonist which is potentially useful in the management of Parkinson's disease. 
This review describes the development of a transdermal iontophoretic delivery system for R-apomorphine on the basis of integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) investigations in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
This shows the need for individualized and carefully controlled delivery of R-apomorphine in Parkinson's disease. 
Transdermal iontophoretic transport was studied both in vitro in human stratum corneum and dermatomed full skin and in vivo in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
It is concluded that the delivery of R-apomorphine by transdermal iontophoresis may be an attractive tool in future clinical pharmacological investigations in patients with Parkinson's disease aiming at characterization of the influence of chronic treatment and disease progression on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by the mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal loss, possibly by apoptosis, and the prevalence is higher in males than in females. 
 L-dopa is the major treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but its efficacy is limited by the presence of dyskinesia. 
 Presynaptic denervation is likely to play an important role in the pathophysiology of dyskinesias that develop after levodopa administration to patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Tinuvin 123, a compound used in the manufacture of plastics, has recently been suggested to possibly cause Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the appearance of intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB) in dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the progressive loss of these neurons. 
The aetiology of this disorder is still unknown, but a recent study showed an association between RBD and Parkinson's disease. 
We compared the [123I]IPT-SPECT results of five patients with polysomnographically confirmed idiopathic RBD with the [123I]IPT-SPECTs of seven age- and sex-matched controls without a history of sleep disorders, and of 14 patients with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage I). 
All RBD patients had significantly reduced striatal [123I]IPT binding compared with the controls (RBD: right, 2.94 +/- 0.32, left, 3.03 +/- 0.41; controls: right, 4.41 +/- 0.17, left, 4.34 +/- 0.21; P = 0.003), but significantly higher striatal [123I]IPT binding compared with the striatum contralateral to the symptomatic body side of the Parkinson's disease patients (Parkinson's disease: ipsilateral, 3.17 +/- 0.36, P = 0.298; contralateral, 2.51 +/- 0.31, P = 0.019). 
This finding may have clinical relevance to the therapeutic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta triggers a cascade of functional changes affecting the whole basal ganglia network. 
The identification of the role of the subthalamic nucleus and, more in general, of the glutamatergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease might lead to a new approach in the pharmacological treatment of the disease. 
Drugs capable of antagonizing the effects of glutamate might represent, in the next future, a valuable tool for the development of new symptomatic and neuroprotective strategies for therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Twenty non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]beta-CIT to further investigate the contribution of nigrostriatal dysfunction to cognitive and motor deficits. 
 Chronic dopaminomimetic administration to parkinsonian animal models or Parkinson's disease patients leads to characteristic alteration in motor response. 
 Recent works suggest that alpha-synuclein could play a central role in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Altogether, our study indicates that wild-type alpha-synuclein exerts an antiapoptotic effect in neurons that appears to be abolished by the Parkinson's disease-related mutation, thereby suggesting a possible mechanism underlying both sporadic and familial forms of this neurodegenerative disease. 
These results provide further evidence that inhibitors of nNOS may be useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and parkinson plus syndrome, overactive pallidal and nigral inhibitory inputs to the PPN may cause sequential occurrences of PPN hypofunction, decreased excitatory PPN input to the substantia nigra, and aggravation of striatal dopamine deficiency. 
 BACKGROUND: There is debate about whether the initial treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease should be levodopa or a dopamine agonist. 
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared the safety and efficacy of the dopamine D2-receptor agonist ropinirole with that of levodopa over a period of five years in 268 patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: Early Parkinson's disease can be managed successfully for up to five years with a reduced risk of dyskinesia by initiating treatment with ropinirole alone and supplementing it with levodopa if necessary. 
We investigated the functional effects of embryonic porcine dopaminergic neurons transplanted in a rat model of Parkinson's disease and the immune responses to the grafts in immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed hosts. 
 A multicenter study is under way to investigate the efficacy of allografting of embryonic mesencephalic neurons in a pig model of Parkinson's disease. 
Several studies postulated that the STN plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and that its inhibition or its lesioning can reverse the cardinal motor symptoms. 
The evidence reviewed in the present article clearly demonstrates that the STN is implicated in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Neural transplantation is developing into a therapeutic alternative in Parkinson's disease. 
These recent advances provide hope for improved survival of transplanted neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease, reducing the need for human embryonic donor tissue and increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome. 
 The effect of apomorphine on visual functions in Parkinson's disease (PD) was evaluated by use of a static contrast sensitivity test (VCTS charts), a colour discrimination test (Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test) and the examination of achromatic and chromatic contour perception. 
 Missense mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene were associated with a familial Parkinson's disease, and alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, the intracellular inclusions that neuropathologically characterize Parkinson's disease. 
Our data illustrate the selective neurotoxic effect of NAC for dopaminergic neurons and support the central role of alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the effect of amantadine versus placebo on levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. 
 MPTP produces clinical, biochemical, and neuropathologic changes reminiscent of those that occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In Parkinson's disease, there is a marked reduction of these receptors associated with the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron loss. 
AIMS: We performed a double blind placebo controlled crossover pilot study in seven patients to investigate the effect of the ACE inhibitor, perindopril on the clinical features of moderately severe Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ACE inhibitors such as perindopril may have a place in the management of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease and justify further study. 
 L-Deprenyl, an irreversible MAO-B (monoamine oxidase B, EC 1.4.3.4) inhibitor, is used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and to delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease. 
 A new capillary electrophoresis method to determine simultaneously eight of the most important anti-Parkinson's disease compounds has been developed. 
Because complex I dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, the accumulation of DOPAL may explain the vulnerability of the dopaminergic system to complex I inhibition. 
 OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of adjunct pergolide therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease suffering from the complications of levodopa therapy. 
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of pergolide versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy. 
The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of drop outs and adverse events. 
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Based on this single large multicentre study, pergolide reduces 'off' time and improves impairment and disability due to Parkinson's disease whilst allowing a reduction in levodopa dose. 
The role of genetic polymorphisms in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, is also discussed. 
This suggests that changes of NMDA receptor mediated control of the striatofugal pathways occur during Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) could be explained by a central executive (CE) deficit in A. 
It has been known since 100 years, and in Parkinson's disease it was used first in 1970 by Schwab and Cotzias. 
Apomorphine is used in Parkinson's disease with high-grade fluctuations of symptoms which cannot be controlled by oral drugs, especially in off" periods resistant to levodopa. 
The authors treated 8 patients with marked fluctuations in Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa. 
 The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is capable of producing a syndrome in mice which shares major characteristics with human Parkinson's disease. 
This is the first report suggesting that DADLE can be used as a supplement factor for improving the cell viability of fetal mesencephalic cells and as a protective agent against neurotoxicity in a Parkinson's disease model. 
 Although there have been experimental approaches to understanding the etiology of Parkinson's disease, the cause of cell degeneration in this neurological disorder remains a mystery. 
The shift in depressive and excitatory behavior is characteristic of most psychiatric disorders, addictions, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and psychosomatic disorders. 
Thus, altered glial function leading to TNF-alpha-mediated or GDNF withdrawal-induced dopaminergic apoptosis may contribute to nigral degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major neurologic disorder that distinctively and selectively affects movement and--by extension--the motor system. 
 Several abnormalities of visual function have been demonstrated in Parkinson's disease (PD) by both electrophysiologic and psychophysical testing. 
Prolonged visual evoked potential latencies and abnormal electroretinographic patterns, both of which respond to levodopa therapy, have been demonstrated in Parkinson's disease patients and in primates with experimental parkinsonism suggesting that retinal dopamine deficiency is an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD visual dysfunction. 
The clinician must be aware, however, that several forms of disability ranging from gait freezing to visual hallucinations may be linked to an underlying impairment of visual function in Parkinson's disease. 
 The olfactory system is one of the nonmotor systems severely affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Clinical evaluation of selective NR2B antagonists may be warranted in Parkinson's disease. 
 Much evidence indicates that abnormal GABA neurotransmission may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dopaminomimetic-induced dyskinesias (DID). 
The distribution of histaminergic fibers in the substantia nigra (SN) in postmortem brain samples from patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal controls was examined with a specific immunohistochemical method. 
Similarly, dopamine and its oxidation products were suggested to trigger dopaminergic nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
Our data suggest these compounds as potential lead compounds for protective therapies against Parkinson's disease. 
 The major neuropathological feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) is severe degeneration of the dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. 
 The goal of this study was to evaluate the validity of the pretreated, unilaterally MPTP-treated monkey as an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In the patients with Parkinson's disease, urinary isatin concentrations tended to increase according to the severity of disease, as classified by the Hoehn and Yahr criteria. 
Isatin significantly increased striatal DA levels in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease those neurons are lost first in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus which contain the greatest amounts of neuromelanins. 
The side effects of L-dopa (immobility episodes alternate with normal or involuntary movements; psychotic abnormalities) suggest that the SDM, their intermediates and the ROSP present naturally in vivo are involved in the cause of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
In this article, we will first review our DA transporter imaging in Parkinson's disease. 
This method showed that patients with Parkinson's disease have markedly reduced DAT levels in striatum, which correlated with disease severity and disease progression. 
CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old male patient with Parkinson's disease developed a severe restrictive pulmonary disorder with dyspnea and nonproductive cough after a daily intake of 45 mg dihydroergocryptine for 2 years. 
The primary goal of this study was to determine whether its regional cerebral distribution could differentiate between patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy human volunteers.METHODS: The sample consisted of 42 patients with Parkinson's disease, 23 age-matched controls, and 38 healthy adults younger than 40 y old. 
There was overlap in the caudate as well as in the anterior-most portion of the putamen, but not in the posterior putamen, even when the asymptomatic sides of 5 patients with clinically defined hemi-Parkinson's disease were factored in. 
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that Parkinson's disease can be detected with [99mTc]TRODAT by simply inspecting the images for uptake in the posterior putamen. 
Appropriate asymmetries seem to be visible with quantification in patients with clinically defined hemi-Parkinson's disease, even though changes in the putamen contralateral to the clinically unaffected side in these patients appear to precede the development of symptoms. 
These data provide the basis for regarding the period from week 6 to week 10 as optimal for transplantation of dopaminergic neurons into the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
This finding is discussed in terms of current therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
NADH has been reported to relieve some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, presumably by altering dopaminergic function. 
 The current diagnostic and treatment paradigm for the akinetic form of Parkinson's disease asserts that the majority of symptoms and treatment phenomena arise from a dysfunctional dopaminergic system. 
 Catalepsy, a symptom of Parkinson's disease and related disorders can be produced in rats and other laboratory animals by the blockade of nigrostriatal dopamine using dopaminergic antagonists such as haloperidol. 
These results provide evidence for sex differences in postural support mechanisms and suggest that the sex of subjects, or their hormonal state, must be considered when studying the behavioral aspects of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease which include a postural component. 
The 1215G was significantly less frequent among patients with Parkinson's disease than the controls. 
Although the polymorphism caused no amino acid substitution, we concluded that it was associated with decreasing the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease through mechanisms other than the protein function of dopamine transporter. 
 Clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) do not manifest until dopamine (DA) neuronal loss reaches a symptomatic threshold. 
 Dyskinesias are observed in the majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who have been chronically exposed to levodopa, and these may result from supersensitivity of postsynaptic striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptors following loss of nigral dopaminergic projections. 
The blink rate is reduced in Parkinson's disease (PD) and increased with dopamine treatment. 
 Dopaminergic agents reverse parkinsonism but commonly induce dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on long-term levodopa therapy. 
Some drugs that block NMDA receptors palliate parkinsonian signs in these animal models, as well as in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These observations support the view that sensitization of striatal NMDA receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. 
 Treatment-related dyskinesias are the major limitation of dopamine replacement therapies such as levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treated primate model of Parkinson's disease provides a unique opportunity to study factors influencing the onset and persistence of dyskinesia induced by levodopa or dopamine agonist treatment. 
However, nonhuman primates with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism readily develop levodopa-induced dyskinesias that are virtually indistinguishable from those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The pathogenesis of the alterations in motor response that complicate levodopa therapy of Parkinson's disease remains obscure. 
Lesions of the dopamine system, such as occur in Parkinson's disease (PD), disrupt this balance. 
 The anatomical and physiological basis of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reviewed in the light of the current model for the organization of the basal ganglia. 
 The most common types of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are chorea and dystonia, and often the two types are intermixed. 
Because it is has been established that GDNF exerts trophic effects on DA neurons, the means currently used to deliver GDNF into the brain could be a viable strategy to prevent the death of nigral DA neurons in cases of Parkinson's disease. 
 Risperidone, a novel neuroleptic with approximately equal D2 and 5HT2A receptor blocking properties, has been used to treat drug-related hallucinations in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Twenty-three patients with Parkinson's disease had either complete or near-complete resolution of hallucinations whereas an unsatisfactory response (N = 6) or worsening of parkinsonism (N = 6) was noted in 12 patients, only six of whom had Parkinson's disease. 
 L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias are one of the main problems encountered in treating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists, such as KW-6002, may be one means of reducing the dosage of L-DOPA used in treating Parkinson's disease and are potentially a novel approach to treating the illness both as monotherapy and in combination with dopaminergic drugs. 
 Some patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease experience hallucinations as a result of treatment with levodopa and dopamine agonists. 
There is evidence for some heterogeneity in these hallucinating patients based on duration of Parkinson's disease at onset of hallucinations. 
This polymorphism may be in linkage disequilibrium with a mutation in DRD2 or a nearby gene that predisposes to drug-induced hallucinations which occur later in the course of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

The expression patterns of alpha-synuclein and parkin mRNAs were similar, suggesting that these two proteins may be involved in common pathways contributing to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings on DRD indicate that the nigrostriatal DA neurons may be most susceptible to the decreases in GCH1 activity, BH4 level, TH activity, and DA level, and that DRD is the DA deficiency without neuronal death in contrast to juvenile parkinsonism or Parkinson's disease with DA cell death. 
 To explore the mechanisms underlying L-dopa response, we studied, by postmortem autoradiography, selective makers of dopamine presynaptic terminals, [3H]WIN 35428, and dopamine D2 receptors, [3H]nemonapride, in the putamen of four Parkinson's disease (PD) and one striatonigral degeneration (SND) neuropathologically confirmed brains as compared with six matched control brains.

As alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists are known to alleviate akinesia in the experimental models of Parkinson's disease, the present results could be especially relevant for the development of palliative treatment for demented Parkinsonian patients. 
 Using functional MRI (fMRI), we have studied the changes induced by the performance of a complex sequential motor task in the cortical areas of six akinetic patients with Parkinson's disease and six normal subjects. 
Compared with the normal subjects, the patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited a relatively decreased fMRI signal in the rostral part of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as previously shown in PET studies. 
These fMRI data confirm that the frontal hypoactivation observed in patients with Parkinson's disease is restricted to the rostral part of the SMA and to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
 Dopamine D2 receptor function was assessed in a PET study with 2 dopamine D2 receptor PET ligands, [11C]raclopride (RAC) and [11C]N-methylspiperone (NMSP), in early Parkinson's disease.METHODS: Seven patients with early Parkinson's disease and 5 healthy volunteers were studied. 
RESULTS: Upregulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the putamen contralateral to the predominant symptoms of Parkinson's disease was confirmed using both [11C]RAC and [11C]NMSP. 
No significant differences between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy volunteers were detected in any of the studied brain regions using either [11C]RAC or [11C]NMSP. 
No significant differences between [11C]RAC and [11C]NMSP uptake were detected in the striatum, whereas in the extrastriatal regions, [11C]NMSP showed significantly higher uptake than [11C]RAC both in healthy volunteers and in Parkinson's disease patients. 
CONCLUSION: This study confirms an increase in dopamine D2 receptors in the putamen contralateral to the predominant symptoms, compared with the ipsilateral putamen, in early Parkinson's disease.

Motor impairment in idiopathic Parkinson's disease progresses from mild to severe, but the therapeutic potential of D(1) dopamine receptor agonists in early and advanced stages of parkinsonism is not known. 
Based on the therapeutic efficacy and side effect profiles derived from these models, D(1) agonists are more promising for the treatment of advanced than of mild Parkinson's disease. 
The application of these paradigms will be reviewed with special emphasis to neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). 
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), with brain lesions (e.g. 
However, due to the clear difference in their efficacy in decreasing dopamine release, in spite of the similar agonist binding affinities to the dopamine D(2) receptor of the two analogs compared to R-(-)-apomorphine, they could be useful alternatives for apomorphine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The aim of the present study was to examine if selected polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is an obvious target for the development of gene therapy procedures which could involve both the delivery of the gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase to boost dopamine production or the delivery of genes encoding neurotrophic factors such as GDNF to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons. 
Some of these early behavioral changes after unilateral nigrostriatal lesion are related to DA depletion and should therefore be useful to predict lesion size.Together, these data suggest that the study of such behavioral changes can provide an important tool, to investigate the compensatory mechanisms underlying striatal DA depletion and to understand preclinical states of the Parkinson's disease.

These results suggest that urinary isatin may become a diagnostic marker for the clinical severity of Parkinson's disease and that endogenous isatin, a new biological modulator, may play a role in the regulation of the brain levels of ACh by increasing the level of DA under stress. 
When considering gene therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), vector delivery prior to the onset of neuropathology is not possible and chronic delivery will likely be necessary in a GDNF-based PD therapy.

 In Parkinson's disease, changes in GABAergic activity occurring downstream of the striatal dopamine loss are accompanied by reciprocal changes in GABA(A) receptor binding, the underlying molecular mechanisms for which are unknown. 
This study examined whether changes in expression of the genes encoding known GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha(1-4), beta(1-3), gamma(1-3) and delta) could account for this receptor plasticity using a rodent model of Parkinson's disease with a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal lesion. 
Moreover, they provide a molecular basis by which the pathological changes in GABAergic activity in Parkinson's disease may be partially compensated. 
 The interactions existing between substance P- and dopamine-positive neurons, notably in the basal ganglia, suggest that substance P may have therapeutic use in treatment of Parkinson's disease characterized by impaired dopaminergic transmission. 
The results of this study suggest that substance P helps to restore dopamine deficit in the brain in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, with the positive effects being more prominent on the nigrostriatal than on the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, but substance P(5-11) is not responsible for this effect. 
These findings are incorporated into a new model of L-DOPA's actions in the reserpinized rat, and their possible implications for our understanding of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease are discussed. 
However, this D(1)-D(2) interdependence may alter under certain conditions and may play a role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.

The results presented suggest a need for further studies on the potential of stimulating kappa-opioid and/or alpha-adrenoreceptors as a therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, the studies may offer potential mechanistic explanations of the ability of alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
Lesion of this pathway in rats causes locomotor alterations that resemble some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and significantly alters the excitatory transmission in the striatum.

 In the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease, apomorphine has an established place as a back-up therapy if other antiparkinsonian drugs, such as levodopa and oral dopamine agonists, have not controlled the existing response fluctuations. 
If more population data become available, the population pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of apomorphine could be helpful in predicting the clinical effects of apomorphine in the several subgroups of patients with Parkinson's disease.

In this study, we demonstrate that the selective and potent alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist idazoxan reduces L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease. 
We propose that idazoxan in combination with L-dopa may provide a novel approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease that will not only reduce the dyskinetic side effects, but extend the anti-parkinsonian actions of L-dopa.

These provisional findings suggest that newly developed COMT inhibitors such as tolcapone, applied in Parkinson's disease, might in due time be considered in the treatment of ADHD. 
Therefore, the rationale for delivering l-dopa directly to the striatum to treat Parkinson's disease is sound and the preclinical data are promising but all the issues surrounding this strategy are not resolved.

 Cells expressing a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cDNA under control of the promoter of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene were tested for therapeutic efficacy in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Its promoter is of interest for gene therapy as it is expressed in astrocytes throughout postnatal life and is upregulated in response to almost any damage to the central nervous system, including Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that the GFAP promoter is sufficiently active to enable production of therapeutic levels of dopamine from a GFAP-TH transgene, and suggest the use of astrocytes for gene therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Ropinirole and pramipexole have both been shown to be efficacious when used as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease (PD), and have been suggested as being less likely than levodopa to lead to the early development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in this clinical setting. 
 While dopamine agonists are still traditionally used as adjunct medications to improve performance and smooth out motor response complications in advanced levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease, they are increasingly used in monotherapy or early in combination with levodopa particularly in patients under 65 years of age.

The cause of Parkinson's disease is still an enigma. 
Consequently, the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease consists of symptomatic treatment, with in particular L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and/or dopamine receptor agonists. 
Especially, drugs able to increase the activity of phase II biotransformation enzymes seem to elicit a broad-spectrum (neuro)protective response and look very promising leads for the development of neuroprotective treatment strategies in Parkinson's disease. 
Especially, the introduction of radioligands that bind selectively to the dopamine transporter seems to be a significant step forward for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
Performing these brain imaging studies with fixed time intervals does not only create the possibility to follow the degeneration rate of the dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease but also provides the opportunity to estimate therapeutic effects of putative neuroprotective agents in the individual patient. 
It is proposed that the activation of nigral DA neurons may underlie the beneficial effects of GABA(B)-receptor antagonists in the modulation of cognition and that GABA(B)-receptor antagonists may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Attempts were made to provide some insight into these mechanisms by measuring the levels of the dopamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and met-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple sclerosis (MS) after a 30-minute therapeutic electrical stimulation of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.

Dopaminergic activities have been investigated at coronal levels along the rostrocaudal striatal axis from a post-mortem series of 25 DLB, 14 Parkinson's disease and 17 Alzheimer's disease patients and 20 elderly controls. 
[(3)H]Mazindol binding to the dopamine uptake site was significantly reduced in the caudal putamen in DLB compared with controls (57%), but not as extensively as in Parkinson's disease (75%), and was unchanged in Alzheimer's disease. 
In DLB, [(3)H]raclopride binding to D2 receptors was significantly reduced in the caudal putamen (17%) compared with controls, and was significantly lower than in Parkinson's disease at all levels. 
D2 binding was significantly elevated at all coronal levels in Parkinson's disease compared with controls, most extensively in the rostral putamen (71%). 
The only significant alteration in D1 binding ([(3)H]SCH23390) in the groups examined was an elevation (30%) in the caudal striatum in Parkinson's disease. 
A slight, significant decrease in D3 binding in the caudal striatum of Parkinson's disease (13%) patients and an increase in Alzheimer's disease (20%) in the dorsal striatum at the level of the nucleus accumbens were found. 
The concentration and distribution of dopamine were disrupted in both DLB and Parkinson's disease, although in the caudate nucleus the loss of dopamine in DLB was uniform whereas in Parkinson's disease the loss was greater caudally. 
In the caudal putamen, dopamine was reduced by 72% in DLB and by 90% in Parkinson's disease. 
The homovanillic acid : dopamine ratio, a metabolic index, indicated compensatory increased turnover in Parkinson's disease, which was absent in DLB despite the loss of substantia nigra neurons (49%), dopamine and uptake sites. 
These differences between DLB, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease may explain some characteristics of the extrapyramidal features of DLB and its limited response to L-dopa and severe neuroleptic sensitivity. 
 To achieve accuracy in studying the patterns of loss of midbrain dopamine-containing neurons in Parkinson's disease, we used compartmental patterns of calbindin D(28K) immunostaining to subdivide the substantia nigra with landmarks independent of the degenerative process. 
The spatiotemporal progression of neuronal loss related to disease duration can thus be drawn in the substantia nigra pars compacta for each Parkinson's disease patient: depletion begins in the main pocket (nigrosome 1) and then spreads to other nigrosomes and the matrix along rostral, medial and dorsal axes of progression. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by massive degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons in the midbrain. 
We propose that subdivision of the human substantia nigra based on patterns of calbindin immunostaining provides a key tool for analysing the organization of the substantia nigra and offers a new approach to analysing molecular expression patterns in the substantia nigra and the specific patterns of nigral cell degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
We investigated the cytokine producing capacity for interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in whole blood cultures of de-novo patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) at the time of first diagnosis and after oral amantadine treatment.

 INTRODUCTION: The progression of Parkinson's disease and levodopa therapy leads to development of motor and psychic complications that cause serious limitations to the management of the advanced disease. 
DEVELOPMENT: This article reviews the current literature regarding the pathophysiology and the therapeutic approaches to the management of motor and psychic fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
The most important risk factors for the development of motor fluctuations are the young age at onset and severity of Parkinson's disease, and duration and maximum dose of levodopa. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that is associated with the depletion of dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in specific brain regions. 
 Therapeutic options for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) have expanded tremendously over the last 5 years, although levodopa remains the gold standard of therapy. 
This last result points out one aspect of the complex mechanisms underlying the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. 
 To determine the effects of endogenous and exogenous melatonin on experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to intracerebroventricular implants of slow release melatonin, pinealectomy (PX), or constant light (LL) and then injected with central 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or i.p. 
These findings may have implications as regards the participation of NMDA receptors in the compensatory mechanisms associated with the progress of Parkinson's disease, as well as in the treatment of this neurological disorder. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a massive loss of nigral dopamine neurons that results in a reduction of dopamine concentrations in the striatum. 
In this study, the distribution of D1 dopamine receptors was analyzed at the cellular and subcellular level in the striatum of 5 patients with Parkinson's disease (all treated with levodopa) and 4 control subjects. 
The quantitative analysis performed at the ultrastructural level in patients with Parkinson's disease revealed an increase in immunostaining in the cytoplasm of medium-sized neurons. 
Such a description is convenient to compare catecholaminergic systems in different mammalian species and provide clear anatomical landmarks of the embryonic substantia nigra (midbrain and prosomeres 1 and 2), that are necessary for transplantation of neural tissue in Parkinson's disease. 
 Various investigators address an augmented synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinolines, such as salsolinol (SAL), or an increased N-methylation of these compounds as putative pathophysiologic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD).

To evaluate the neurological and psychiatric features, responses to medications, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with DLB, we compared the above DLB patients with age- and gender-matched Parkinson's disease patients showing no signs of dementia. 
 As a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease, viral vector-mediated over-expression of striatal L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase was tested in an attempt to facilitate the production of therapeutic levels of dopamine after peripheral L-dihydroxyphenylalanine administration. 
These data suggest that the use of the non-pathogenic adeno-associated virus to transfer the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase gene into the striatum of Parkinson's disease patients may be an attractive gene therapy strategy. 
 The degeneration of forebrain dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease has been an effective target for pharmaceutical research over the past four decades.

 Free radicals are involved in the pathology of many CNS disorders, like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or stroke. 
 Since the pioneering work of Hornykiewicz and his colleagues, it has been recognized that dopaminergic cells die selectively in Parkinson's disease, and considerable improvement in symptoms can be achieved by administering levodopa, so that it may be converted to dopamine. 
Now there are also non-ergot derivatives that are D2 agonists, and are likely to have a role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)  The administration of dopamine agonists can have a role early in the course of Parkinson's disease, in an attempt to reduce the frequency of long-term motor complications associated with the use of levodopa. 
These results reinforce the idea that dopamine receptors in the subthalamic nucleus may play an important role in the physiology of the basal ganglia and in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
The results are discussed in the context of the important interaction between the converging glutamatergic corticostriatal and DAergic nigrostriatal pathways in controlling the functional GABAergic output of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and in experimental models of DA deficiency.

Past history included stroke in 7, hypertension in 6, pulmonary tuberculosis in 4, diabetes in 3, asthma in 2, angina pectoris in 1, Parkinson's disease in 1, pneumonia in 1, and hepatitis in 1. 
Subjects (n = 14) with levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease received five doses of ABT-431 (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg) and one of placebo after a 12-hour levodopa holiday. 
Assuming that ABT-431 is not transformed in humans into an unknown active D2 metabolite, and remains selective for D1 receptors, it is the first dopamine D1 receptor agonist to demonstrate a full antiparkinsonian effect in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The emergence of a well-tolerated D1 agonist should allow for the development of a better understanding of the relation between motor efficacy and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
 The management of Parkinson's disease has undergone recent changes with the advent of new therapies, both pharmacotherapy and surgery.

Thus, NO, DNA damage, and PARP activation play a critical role in MPTP-induced parkinsonism and suggest that inhibitors of PARP may have protective benefit in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) are described as having markedly decreased novelty seeking characteristics. 
DRUGS INDUCING HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA: Besides methyldopa, other drugs known to induce hemolytic anemia include levodopa used for Parkinson's disease, mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, interferon-alpha, used in chronic viral hepatitis, cyclosporin used for the prevention of graft rejection and the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases, and fludarabin, used in chronic lymphoid leukemia.THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY: If there is no clinical or biological expression, the drug can be continued, excepting fludarabin where regular controls are needed. 
 Pramipexole, a novel non-ergoline dopamine (DA) agonist, has been applied successfully for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Our results suggest that, in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, pergolide in association with L-DOPA favors the restoration of striatal EC DA levels. 
 Although L-DOPA is the current 'gold standard' for treatment of Parkinson's disease, its effectiveness fades rapidly and its use results in serious motor fluctuations (on-off, wearing off, freezing, involuntary movements) for most patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Pramipexole's preferential affinity for the D3 receptor subtype could contribute to efficacy in the treatment of both the motor and psychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that pramipexole has excellent pharmacokinetic properties and that it is an effective monotherapy in treating early Parkinson's disease and an effective adjunctive therapy with L-DOPA in treating late Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, a new 'L-DOPA-sparing' paradigm for treating Parkinson's disease may now be possible, whereby patients are initially treated with pramipexole and L-DOPA is added only as necessary. 
 The akinesia resulting from Parkinson's disease or striatal dopamine depletion in experimental animals can be ameliorated or reversed by inactivation of the subthalamic nucleus. 
 OBJECT: Transplants of adrenal medulla (AM) and fetal ventral mesencephalon (FVM) are currently being tested as therapeutic alternatives in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results further implicate metabolic dysfunction in MPTP neurotoxicity and suggest a novel therapeutic approach, which may have applicability for Parkinson's disease. 
 Cabergoline is one of several ergoline dopamine agonist medications used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. 
Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and nigrostriatal pathway of the midbrain. 
Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficacious treatment for Parkinson's disease, but dopamine agonists, formerly prescribed only as adjunctive therapy, are emerging as useful initial therapy. 
 BACKGROUND: To identify which clinical factors can modify the probability of the appearance of the psychotic syndromes in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa. 
 A variety of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that dopamine is a toxic molecule that may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and ischemia-induced striatal damage. 
The disposition and metabolic fate of ropinirole, a novel compound indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease, was studied in the mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey and man, following oral and intravenous administration of ropinirole hydrochloride. 
These results are similar to changes in GABA and glutamate synapses that follow nigrostriatal dopamine loss in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals and in Parkinson's disease, and provide the first direct evidence that methamphetamine-induced dopamine loss alters the GABAergic striatopallidal pathway. 
Our results suggest that molecules that modulate adenine nucleotide/nucleoside release may be useful for the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative conditions affecting dopaminergic neurons, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Little is currently known concerning the mechanisms responsible for the excessive deposition of redox-active iron in the substantia nigra of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Further analysis of the polymorphism of the human Nurr1 gene may reveal the association with diseases characterized by changes of the DA system, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
OBJECTIVE: To compare rapid- versus slow-titration schedules for starting a new dopamine agonist in patients already on chronic agonist therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
The effects of Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 analogues 3a-3d and 4a-4d on enhancing rotational behavior induced by apomorphine in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animal models of Parkinson's disease were studied. 
 Pramipexole (SND 919), a potent non-ergot dopamine agonist, or placebo, was administered to 69 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (33 received placebo, 36 received pramipexole) in a double-blind, randomized, multi-center study in which individually optimized doses of L-dopa plus a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor were associated with dyskinesia, "on-off" fluctuation, dystonia, akinesia, or end-of-dose deterioration. 
Treatment with pramipexole in doses up to 5 mg/day was safe and well tolerated by patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.Copyright Lippincott-Raven Publishers  At the initial stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa (LD) is able to reduce most motor symptoms and to significantly improve the patient's quality of life. 
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether striatal morphology on a three-dimensional surface display of 123I-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (123I-beta-CIT) SPECT data can be used as a diagnostic index for Parkinson's disease.METHODS: We studied 11 patients with mild Parkinson's disease and 21 age-matched controls. 
The power of L/H to discriminate Parkinson's disease and control groups was evaluated by discriminant function analysis and was compared with that of region of interest (ROI)-based 123I-beta-CIT binding measurements (V"3) and their ratios. 
RESULTS: The mean L/H ratios (ipsilateral/contralateral) to the most affected limbs were (33%/45%) lower in the Parkinson's disease group compared with the control group, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that striatal morphology on a three-dimensional display of 123I-beta-CIT SPECT data provides information of diagnostic significance for Parkinson's disease. 
 The precursor of non-amyloid beta protein component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP/alpha-synuclein), found in Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease (PD), is a presynaptic protein genetically linked to some familial types PD. 
Therefore, the clinical effects of sex steroids on parkinsonian symptoms in postmenopausal women with Parkinson's disease (PD) were analyzed in the present study. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1 million persons in the United States. 
METHODS: Seventy eight patients of either sex with advanced Parkinson's disease and treatment complications such as motor fluctuations were enrolled into a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, multicentre study (phase II) and assigned to add on treatment with pramipexole (n=34) versus placebo (n=44) to a previously stabilised antiparkinsonian medication (7 week dose titration interval, 4 week maintenance period). 
The primary end point of efficacy was the change from baseline in the total score of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) in the on "period" (2 hours after intake of study medication). 
CONCLUSION: Pramipexole administration is an efficacious and well tolerated add on therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with an improvement in activities of daily living, motor function, and treatment associated complications. 
Thus, pharmacological targeting of excitatory amino acid systems could provide alternative or complementary treatment strategies for diseases involving dopaminergic systems in the striatum (e.g., Parkinson's disease) and cortex (e.g., schizophrenia). 
 Deficits in forepaw adjusting steps in rats have been proposed as a non-drug-induced model of the akinesia associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Together, these results suggest that forepaw adjusting step deficits in the rat provide a good model for the akinesia of Parkinson's disease both in medial forebrain bundle and striatal lesions, and would be a useful tool for investigating the efficacy of various therapeutic strategies. 
 Drugs and certain environmental toxins may be responsible for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
The results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress may be contributing to the apoptotic cell death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to the manifestation of Parkinson's disease. 
Since paraquat was an important herbicide in the mid 20th Century, our results have the important implication that exposure to environmental toxins such as paraquat may induce Parkinson's disease. 
 Tremor is a symptom of many disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, orthostatic tremor, cerebellar disease, peripheral neuropathy and alcohol withdrawal. 
 A decreased motor response after repeated doses of apomorphine is observed in severely affected Parkinson's disease patients. 
 The vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) has been suggested to be an excellent marker of presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum of Parkinson's disease patients based on its high level of expression and insensitivity to drugs used to treat the disease. 
Previous in vivo imaging and postmortem binding studies have detected a loss in striatal VMAT2 binding in Parkinson's diseased (PD) brain; however, these techniques have poor spatial resolution and may suffer from nonspecific binding of some ligands. 
These observations could have implications for theories on the cause of Parkinson's disease. 
 Medical therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited by the short-duration response and development of dyskinesia that result from chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy. 
 The akinesia resulting from Parkinson's disease or striatal dopamine depletion in experimental animals can be ameliorated or reversed by inactivation of the subthalamic nucleus. 
These observations suggest a role of the D3 receptor in the progressive increase in the therapeutic efficacy of levodopa in the initial treatment of Parkinson's disease, and/or its adversive motor and psychopathological effects during long-term treatment. 
Refinements in the use of this neurotoxin led to the use of dopamine-denervated animals as models of human Parkinson's disease, in which the loss of dopaminergic neurons is a prominent feature. 
Although 6-OHDA-lesioned animals, that display some biochemical characteristics of Parkinson's disease in humans, do not express all of the neurological features exhibited by patients, the increasing knowledge that can be obtained from studies in simplified experimental models will undoubtedly lead to the development of innovative drugs and other replacement therapies for degenerative brain diseases. 
 One of the primary areas of investigation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of the dopamine-producing cells in the melanized neurons of the substantia nigra, believed to be caused by oxidative stress resulting from excessive free radical activity. 
From a therapeutic point of view, the above-mentioned agonists are used for treating Parkinson's disease, acting over DA 2 dopaminergic receptors of the nigrostriatal system. 
These toxic events may contribute to the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 The herbicide paraquat, bearing structural similarity to the known dopaminergic neurotoxicant MPTP, has been suggested as a potential etiologic factor in Parkinson's disease. 
 The modified Dixon equation was applied to describe the relationship between levodopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3OMD) concentrations and tapping test in 16 patients with Parkinson's disease treated with controlled release levodopa/carbidopa association. 
As technology progresses, some vectors will prove more effective for certain disease categories than others; it is too early to predict definitively which vector would be most effective for therapy in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. 
Nonetheless, it is likely that within the next year or two a gene therapy trial will be instituted in human patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Clinicians may be on the threshold of a new era of intervention for Parkinson's disease and other neurologic diseases, based on bypassing traditional but less selective drug-extracellular receptor interactions and instead focusing on genetic modulation of specific intracellular processes. 
 Dopamine agonists have been used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) since the mid 1970s. 
 The two major questions in the treatment of early PD are (1) Does selegiline slow neuronal loss and delay the progression of clinical disability? and (2) Should dopamine agonists be used as initial symptomatic therapy in early disease rather than levodopa/PDI to reduce long-term disability and delay the onset of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia? Selegiline affords neuroprotection for dopamine neurons in cell culture systems and the results of several clinical trials are consistent with the hypothesis that it is neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease. 
These trials will provide more definitive answers to guide the early medial management of Parkinson's disease in the future. 
 We investigated the effect of an anticholinergic (biperiden) and a dopamine agonist (apomorphine) on tremor, rigidity, and akinesia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a multitude of environmental, neurochemical, and genetic factors. 
To test the hypothesis that the DRD4 polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, we have examined differences in allele frequencies of different DRD4 polymorphisms in 101 Chinese patients with PD and in 105 age-matched control subjects in Hong Kong. 
None of the variable number tandem repeat polymorphism showed evidence for genetic association with Parkinson's disease. 
 The monoamine oxidase B gene (MAOB; Xp15.21-4) is a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD) given its role in dopamine metabolism and its possible role in the activation of neurotoxins. 
The association of MAOB polymorphisms (a [GT] repeat allelic variation in intron 2 and an A-G transition in intron 13) with Parkinson's disease (PD) was studied in an Australian cohort of 204 (male:female ratio 1.60) people with PD and 285 (male:female ratio 1.64) age- and gender-matched control subjects. 
 The contribution of the dopamine-synthetic capacity of nigral neuronal subregions to their vulnerability to degeneration in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) was explored using semiquantitative in situ hybridization to study expression of mRNA encoding the rate-limiting dopamine synthetic enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). 
 A randomized, prospective study was carried out in order to investigate the efficacy of a dopamine agonist, lisuride, alone or in combination with levodopa, to minimize or postpone the development of motor fluctuations, compared with levodopa alone during 10 years' treatment of 90 patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
In conclusion, according to the results obtained, it seems reasonable to consider a treatment strategy in early Parkinson's disease using a dopamine agonist, like lisuride, as the primary treatment and to delay the addition of levodopa until parkinsonian disability cannot be adequately controlled by a dopamine agonist. 
 This article examines depression in 6 medical conditions: coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Parkinson's disease, pain, and the sex hormone changes of aging. 
Dopamine agonists may benefit depression associated with Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa is still the mainstay of the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
New insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease have led to the promising concepts of neuroprotection and neurorestoration. 
In daily practice therapeutic management of Parkinson's disease is still symptomatic. 
 Although the aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative disorders is still unknown, recent evidence from human and experimental animal models suggests that a misregulation of iron metabolism, iron-induced oxidative stress and free radical formation are major pathogenic factors. 
The pathogenesis of the selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is still enigmatic. 
Aminochrome is of particular interest as an oxidation product of dopamine and of possible significance in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, and cyanoDMNG is a model for genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic nitroso compounds. 
Neural transplantation is one promising approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
We review experimental studies for application of neural transplantation techniques in Parkinson's disease, including immunological studies, cryopreservation, microvasculature, donor tissue, and direct gene delivery studies performed in our laboratory. 
In juvenile parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease, which have dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia as HPD/DRD, the GCH gene may be normal, and the molecular mechanism of the dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia is different from that in HPD/DRD. 
 This study addresses two issues: (1) the comparative neurochemistry of classic tremor type of Parkinson's disease or PD-A and akinetic type of Parkinson's disease or PD-B; and (2) the neurochemistry of levodopa failure syndrome (LDFS). 
Cerebrospinal fluid from the lateral ventricle was collected from 50 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of PD-A and PD-B. 
 Levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease has been suggested to contribute to disease progression through free radical generation. 
The "MPTP story" hypothesizes that Parkinson's disease may be initiated or percipitated by environmental and/or endogenous toxins by a mechanism similar to that of MPTP in genetically-predisposed individuals. 
Several classes of heterocyclic molecules structurally related to MPTP have been advanced as possible neurotoxicant precursors underlying the nigrostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicated that beta C is a selective dopaminergic toxin precursor, that is sequentially methylated to form 2,9-Me2 beta C+ that could be an underlying factor in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 There have been an increasing number of evidences indicating that dopamine-derived N-methyl(R)salsolinol is an endogenous MPTP-like neurotoxin to cause Parkinson's disease. 
In the cerebrospinal fluid from newly diagnosed untreated patients with Parkinson's disease, the level of this toxin was found to increase significantly, compared to control and a disease control, multiple system atrophy. 
We investigated urine and serum samples from three patient groups: (1) 33 in-patients in acute alcohol withdrawal; (2) 30 detoxified in-patients (treated for at least 4 weeks) from a 'motivation station'; and (3) 43 neuro-rehabilitation patients (non-alcoholics; most of them suffering from stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease etc.) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with deuterium-labelled EtG as the internal standard and additionally in the second group of patients using liquid chromatography (LC/MS-MS). 
 Microrecordings were performed during pallidotomy and thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results shed light on the degenerative process of dopamine neurons and suggest that individual differences in developing Parkinson's disease in human may be related to differences of uptake through the DAT of a yet unidentified neurotoxin. 
 Abnormal involuntary movements, or dyskinesias, plague current symptomatic approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The neural mechanisms underlying the generation of dyskinesia following repeated l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) or dopamine agonist administration in Parkinson's disease remain unknown. 
In this study, we have investigated behavioral responses and alterations in the expression of opioid neuropeptide precursors preproenkephalin-A (PPE-A, encoding methionine- and leucine-enkephalin) and preproenkephalin-B (PPE-B), the precursor encoding dynorphins (dynorphin A1-17 and B1-13, leucine-enkephalin, and alpha-neoendorphin) in striatal output pathways of the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Increased PPE-A and PPE-B levels may, through decreasing GABA and glutamate release, respectively, in output nuclei of the basal ganglia, play a role in the development of L-DOPA- and dopamine-agonist induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
These studies suggest that anti-parkinsonian treatments which are not associated with an elevation in PPE-B and/or normalize elevated PPE-A precursor expression, such as NMDA-receptor antagonists or long-acting dopamine D2 receptor agonists, e.g., cabergoline or ropinirole, may reduce dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
 Intrastriatal transplantation of fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM) is currently explored as a potential clinical therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, in patients with psychosis arising from Parkinson's disease it seems to be the drug of choice, and similar activity is likely for olanzapine. 
In an open-labelled six-week study, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), treated with levodopa/benserazide, were given tolcapone at 200 mg t.i.d. 
 We report ease of conversion, effect on equivalent efficacy and frequency of dosing when immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet, IR-CL, DuPont Pharma, Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.) is replaced with controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet CR, CR-CL, DuPont Pharma, Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In an open-label trial, 14 patients (12 de novo and 2 on levodopa treatment) with Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 to 3 Parkinson's disease were placed on rimantadine at doses of 100 to 300 mg/d. 
We conclude that rimantadine has some motor benefits in Parkinson's disease. 
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the interaction between therapeutic dosages of ropinirole and L-dopa plus a decarboxylase inhibitor administered at steady state in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
PATIENTS: Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease not previously treated with dopamine agonists, of whom 28 produced evaluable pharmacokinetic data for ropinirole and 23 for L-dopa. 
Ropinirole is a nonergoline dopamine agonist that binds to dopamine D2-receptors; the drug is indicated for use in the symptomatic treatment of early and late Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is important for the potential application of neuroprotective therapies. 
 To clarify alcohol drinking habits of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Japanese, we compared mean values of alcohol consumption of PD patients and controls with special references to genetic polymorphism of ALDH2. 
 Neuromelanin in the substantia nigra may be associated with the pathogenesis of nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
These findings may contribute to our understanding of the formation and disposition of neuromelanin and its possible role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. 
 Indirect evidence from human and monkey investigations supports the idea that impaired frontal tasks in Parkinson's disease (PD) may result from striato-frontal disruption caused by dopamine (DA) denervation of the caudate nucleus. 
 The time course of the loss in presynaptic dopamine transporters (DAT) and of the increase in postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) was studied in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
From these animal experiments, it can be assumed that PE2I would be very efficient for the detection of a reduction in the number of DAT reflecting neuronal loss, thus allowing early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, [18F]beta-CFT uptake was studied in nine patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) without antiparkinsonian medication and in six age-matched controls. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the depletion of dopamine in the caudate putamen. 
The method was tested in a rat model of Parkinson's disease produced by lesioning the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine. 
 We studied a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene in search of an association with Parkinson's disease in a French population. 
The aim of this study was to assess the value of different ROI approaches in differentiating patients with normal or increased numbers of D2 dopamine receptors (group 1 = Parkinson's disease, n = 8) from patients with decreased dopamine D2 receptors (group 2 = other extrapyramidal syndromes, n = 9) using 123I-iodolisuride SPET (ILIS-SPET). 
We conclude that the occipital cortex is the best reference for the semi-quantitative evaluation of dopamine D2 receptors as the frontal cortex could include some dopamine D2 receptor-bound radioligand, and that the caudate/occipital ratio is an appropriate parameter for differentiating Parkinson's disease from non-Parkinson extrapyramidal syndrome by 123I-iodolisuride SPET. 
 Parkinsonism is a feature of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
 With the exception of thalamotomy for drug-refractory tremor, surgical therapy for Parkinson's disease has been almost abandoned as treatment for Parkinsonian symptoms between 1965 and 1985. 
Reasons for this development relate to inconsistent postoperative results, complications associated with stereotactic surgical techniques and, most importantly, the advent of levodopa, which is still considered to be the gold standard in pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease. 
However, both, the long-term experience with L-DOPA therapy on the one hand and the progress of advanced stereotactic techniques and fetal graft research on the other hand have lead to reconsideration of surgical therapy in Parkinson's disease for patients, who can not be treated satisfactorily with medication. 
The present data support the view of an increased glutamatergic regulation of striatal acetylcholine release via pre- and postsynaptic NMDA receptors during Parkinson's disease. 
 Resting and postural tremor may occur in essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Chromogranin A (CGA), a prohormone and a protein component of endocrine and neural secretory granules, neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, inhibited the release of dopamine (DA) from perfused rat striatal slices. 
Taken together with our previous reports showing behavioral and histochemical effects of melatonin on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, the present results strongly support the hypothesis that melatonin, as an antioxidant, may have beneficial effects on therapeutic approaches for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Furthermore, the data point to the possibility that a reduced dopaminergic tone at subthalamic dopamine D1 receptors might contribute to akinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: A multicentre randomized double-blind parallel group study was carried out on 68 patients suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with L-dopa for at least 1 year with inadequate therapeutic responsiveness. 
 So far, no clear correlation has been found between the effects of dopamine D1 receptor agonists on motor behavior in primate models of Parkinson's disease and their ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase in rats, the benzazepine SKF 83959 (3-methyl-6-chloro-7,8-hydroxy-1-[3-methylphenyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-]H- 3-benzazepine) being the most striking example. 
 Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain are the primary neuronal population affected by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity, which produces the pathological and behavioral features of Parkinson's disease in nonhuman primates and man. 
 Current symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease is based largely on dopamine-replacing agents. 
In the present study, we demonstrate that selective blockade of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors with the polyamine antagonists ifenprodil and eliprodil causes a significant increase in locomotor activity in the reserpine-treated rat model of Parkinson's disease (30 mg/kg ifenprodil, 221.2 +/- 54 mobile counts compared to vehicle, 19.6 +/- 6.87, P < 0.001). 
Thus, we propose that NR2B-selective NMDA receptor antagonists may prove useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings support the notion of a potential benefit of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These data implicate a c-jun N-terminal kinase signaling system in MPTP-mediated dopaminergic degeneration and suggest that CEP-1347/KT-7515 may have potential as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: We imaged the dopamine re-uptake system with [O-methyl-11C]beta-CFT ([11C]beta-CFT) in three severely affected individuals with RDP and four patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). 
 The effect of increasing delay on the metrics of remembered saccades was studied in 10 subjects with mild Parkinson's disease, none of whom was receiving treatment with L-dopa, and nine age-matched control subjects. 
Reflexive saccades were normal in subjects with Parkinson's disease, but remembered saccades showed marked hypometria of primary saccade gain at all delays. 
FEP gain was unimpaired in Parkinson's disease, and primary saccade gain and FEP gain did not vary as a function of delay. 
Hypometria of primary saccades is compatible with dysfunction in striato-collicular inhibitory pathways in Parkinson's disease, arising as a functional consequence of dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. 
Maintenance of an accurate FEP gain suggests no deficit in oculomotor spatial working memory in Parkinson's disease, at least at delays of up to 5 sec. 
 Tolcapone is a selective peripheral and central catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor recently approved as adjunctive therapy in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are already being treated with a levodopa-peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) combination. 
Although the main objective of drug treatment in Parkinson's disease remains clinical improvement with an optimum dose and frequency of levodopa administration, tolcapone may prove a useful adjunct to such therapy, especially in the presence of the wearing-off and on-off phenomena. 
Degraded L-DOPA responses and appearance of involuntary movements after chronic L-DOPA use in advanced Parkinson's disease may derive from these IEG changes. 
 To demonstrate the cellular distributions of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4) in the intrastriatal grafts of a rat model of Parkinson's disease, immunocytochemistry was performed in 6-hydroxydopamine rats with intrastriatal transplants of fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM). 
 Three patients with Parkinson's disease are described who developed pericardial, retroperitoneal, and pleural fibrosis associated with pergolide treatment. 
We suggest that patients with Parkinson's disease who receive pergolide treatment should be regularly monitored for the development of such complications. 
D2R-knockout mice lack these retinoic acid receptors and exhibit a defect in locomotor ability similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. 
In this paper, the influence of ageing on DA biosynthesis, levels, metabolism and receptors are reviewed in laboratory rodents, monkeys and humans as well as in cases of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
 Susceptibility to develop Parkinson's disease has been linked to abnormalities of P450 enzyme function. 
Multiple P450 enzymes are expressed in brain but the relationship of these to Parkinson's disease is unknown. 
CYP2E1 is a potent generator of free radicals which may contribute to nigral pathology in Parkinson's disease. 
The expression of CYP2E1 in dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra raises the possibility of a causal association with Parkinson's disease. 
Higher doses of GDNF would probably be needed using the intracerebroventricular route as compared to intraparenchymal delivery to exert effects on the nigrostriatal system in Parkinson's disease patients. 
These studies demonstrate that Ad GDNF can sustain increased levels of biosynthesized GDNF in the terminal region of DA neurons for at least 7 weeks and that this GDNF slows the degeneration of DA neurons and prevents the appearance of dopamine dependent motor asymmetries in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The consequences of this activity are critically discussed in relation to the protective action of riluzole previously reported in various models of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. 
 In animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), glutamate antagonists diminish levodopa (LD)-associated motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. 
These results may have implications for the impact of glutamate antagonists on the ability of patients with Parkinson's disease to tolerate stress. 
 This study examines the hypothesis that glutamate tonically suppresses the activity of the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and hence the biosynthesis of dopamine, to explain how antagonists of glutamate receptors might potentiale the motor actions of L-DOPA in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
Glutamate as the transmitter of the corticofugal projections to the basal ganglia nuclei and of the subthalamic neurons is critically involved in basal ganglia functions and dysfunctions; for example Parkinson's disease can be considered to be a secondary hyperglutamatergic disease. 
The present study demonstrates the interaction between sodium ascorbate and dopamine, which might modify their biological activities and generation of nerve disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied in temporal reproduction tasks. 
This paper focuses on dopaminergic, cholinergic and histaminergic parameters in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Taken together, these findings offer new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of dopamine-linked disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. 
Among disorders associated with a primary impairment of dopaminergic transmission are Parkinson's disease, striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and possibly schizophrenia. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a severe decrease in dopamine in the striatum. 
Thus, our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and the dopaminergic neurones play an important role in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These factors are reflected in the treatment of both conditions; drugs aimed at increasing DA are prescribed to patients with Parkinson's disease, while most antipsychotic drugs block and reduce the effects of DA. 
 The recent advances in the treatment of Parkinson's disease have made for significant improvements in the quality of life and mortality rate of those who suffer from this neurodegenerative disease.

This study reports on the reliability and reproducibility of [I23I]FP-CIT SPECT in healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease using two different analysis protocols: the conventional region of interest (ROI) protocol and a newly developed, fully automatic, operator-independent volume of interest (VOI) protocol.METHODS: We performed repeated [123I]FP-CIT SPECT scans in 6 healthy control subjects and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease to measure scan-to-scan variations. 
In Parkinson's disease patients, we found mean test/retest for the striatal-to-nonspecific [123I]FP-CIT ratio of (1.78 +/- 0.23/1.79 +/- 0.25) and (1.83 +/- 0.31/1.85 +/- 0.35) using the ROI and VOI technique, respectively.

 Oral levodopa is the most effective symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Monotherapy with dopamine agonists in early Parkinson's disease has been advocated in order to delay the occurrence of complications associated with long term administration of levodopa. 
In early stages of Parkinson's disease, dopamine agonists can produce a clinical response comparable with levodopa but, thereafter, their efficacy wanes.

 Idiopathic Parkinson's disease involves the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in the presynaptic breakdown of dopaminergic transmission in the striatum. 
 Although the role of dopamine dysfunction is well established in Parkinson's disease, the effect of nigrostriatal degeneration on motor performance during normal aging is less well understood. 
The correlation of motor deficits with the loss of TH-ir and DAT-ir nigral neurons suggests that aged nonhuman primates may provide a useful model for mimicking changes seen in human aging and early Parkinson's disease.

In addition to its effects on cultured fetal midbrain dopamine neurons, GDNF promotes recovery of the injured nigrostriatal dopamine system and improves motor functions in rodent and nonhuman primate models of Parkinson's disease. 
The powerful neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties of GDNF seen in preclinical studies suggest that trophic factors may play an important role in treating Parkinson's disease. 
 A new approach in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is the inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) with new generation COMT inhibitors, entacapone and tolcapone. 
Clinically, the improved levodopa availability is seen as prolonged motor response to levodopa/DDC inhibitor and also as prolonged duration of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose fluctuations. 
The dyskinesias are managed by decreasing the daily levodopa dose in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose fluctuations. 
Thus, COMT inhibitors are clinically significant and beneficial adjunct to levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose fluctuations.

METHODS: In a series of DLB cases, with and without neuroleptic sensitivity, substantia nigra neuron densities, striatal dopamine and homovanillic acid concentrations, and autoradiographic [3H]mazindol and [3H]raclopride binding (to the dopamine transporter and D2 receptor, respectively) were analyzed and compared to control and idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases. 
RESULTS: D2 receptors were up-regulated in neuroleptictolerant DLB and Parkinson's disease compared to DLB without neuroleptic exposure and controls. 
Dopamine uptake sites were reduced concomitantly with substantia nigra neuron density in Parkinson's disease compared to controls, but there was no significant correlation between substantia nigra neuron density and [3H]mazindol binding in DLB groups.

 Sensory disturbances such as olfactory or visual dysfunctions are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The finding of a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene in a rare autosomal dominant form of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), has prompted increased interest in identifying genes that account for the more common sporadic form. 
 The cause of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. 
However, isoquinoline derivatives structurally related to the selective dopaminergic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its active metabolite, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinim (MPP+), have emerged as candidate endogenous neurotoxins causing nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
In conclusion, the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-like cytotoxic characteristics of isoquinoline derivatives and the endogenous/environmental presence of these compounds make it conceivable that high concentrations of and/or prolonged exposure to isoquinoline derivatives might cause neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease in humans. 
 The purposes of this study were to develop a method for nonuniform attenuation correction of 123I emission brain images based on transmission imaging with a longer-lived isotope (i.e., 57Co) and to evaluate the relative improvement in quantitative SPECT images achieved with nonuniform attenuation correction.METHODS: Emission and transmission SPECT scans were acquired on three different sets of studies: a heterogeneous brain phantom filled with 1231 to simulate the distribution of dopamine transporters labeled with 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-123I-iodophenyl)tropane (123I-beta-CIT); nine healthy human control subjects who underwent transmission scanning using two separate line sources (57Co and 123I); and a set of eight patients with Parkinson's disease and five healthy control subjects who received both emission and transmission scans after injection of 123I-beta-CIT. 
When images were analyzed as target-to-background activity ratios, as is commonly performed with 123I-beta-CIT, these outcome measures showed only small differences when Parkinson's disease patients and healthy control subjects were compared using nonuniform, uniform or even no attenuation correction. 
 How do 'stimulants' reduce hyperactivity in children and adults? How can drugs which raise extracellular dopamine result in psychomotor slowing of hyperactive children when dopamine is known to enhance motor activity, such as in Parkinson's disease?

RESULTS: Both [123I]-FPCIT and [123I]-beta-CIT demonstrated decreased striatal uptake in Parkinson's disease patients compared with the controls with a mean of V"3=3.5 and 6.7 for [123I]-beta-CIT (Parkinson's disease and controls, respectively) and a mean of V"3=1.34 and 3.70 for [123I]-FPCIT (Parkinson's disease and controls, respectively). 
For [123I]-beta-CIT, the mean Parkinson's disease values represented 52% of the control uptake, while the mean [123I]-FPCIT value for Parkinson's disease patients was 37% of the control values. 
Analysis of [123I]-FPCIT time-activity curves for specific striatal counts showed washout rates of 8.2%/hr for Parkinson's disease and 4.9%/hr for controls. 
iodine-123-FPCIT washed out from striatal tissue 15-20 times faster than [123I]-beta-CIT, and estimates of dopamine transporter loss in Parkinson's disease patients were higher for [123I]-FPCIT than for [123I]-beta-CIT. 
 To enhance the current therapeutic benefit of dopamine (DA) neuron grafts in Parkinson's disease, strategies must be developed that increase both DA neuron survival and fiber outgrowth into the denervated striatum. 
 Systemic decrease of dopaminergic cells, such as in Parkinson's disease may produce visual alterations in humans. 
In order to show possible pattern electroretinogram (PERG) spatial tuning function (STF) alterations due to impaired dopaminergic transmission in humans, we studied a group of Parkinson's disease patients before and during treatment with the dopamine precursor, levodopa, and compared their performances with those of an age-matched control group. 
Our results showed a clear decrease of PERG responses in Parkinson's disease patients particularly at medium spatial frequency range (2.7-4.0 cycles/degree) with a substantial preservation of responses at low frequencies. 
Levodopa therapy reversed these alterations in Parkinson's disease patients, resulting in the recovery of a normal tuning function shape. 
In contrast to Parkinson's disease, the tuning function appeared to be preserved in post-traumatic parkinsonian patients. 
Although the pathomechanism of post-encephalitic parkinsonism is different from that of Parkinson's disease and TRH possesses a variety of CNS effects as well, these results suggest that TRH-SR play a possible role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in addition to post-encephalitic parkinsonism as a supportive drug of L-DOPA.

METHODS: We studied the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relations of levodopa after a single dose (100 mg levodopa with 25 mg benserazide) among four groups of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
A significant correlation was observed between duration of Parkinson's disease and mean concentration at half-maximal effect (p < 0.001), estimate of maximal response (p < 0.05), and, inversely, equilibration half-life (p < 0.05). 
Due to the central position of dopamine and the documented low NS in Parkinson's disease (PD), the frequency of the exon 3 variants of D4DR in 95 PD patients and 47 controls was investigated.

Nicotinic function in clinical populations and potential for therapeutics has been investigated for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 
We also consider evidence suggesting that some of the cognitive and motor deficits of patients with frontal lesions, Parkinson's disease, or schizophrenia as well as apathy and abulia and rarer phenomena such as primary obsessional slowness can be considered as reflecting im pairment of willed actions. 
Problems remaining to be resolved include: identification of the component processes of willed actions; the specific and differential role played by each of the frontal cortical and subcortical areas in the control of willed actions; the specific mechanisms of impairm ent of willed actions in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and frontal damage; and the precise role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the willed action system. 
It is concluded that adenosine A2A receptors are likely to be important for the parallel organization of primate striatal neurotransmission and that these receptors could be a target for drug therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 Reports of a reduction in the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in tobacco smokers, together with the loss of high-affinity nicotine binding in these diseases, suggest that consequences of nicotinic cholinergic transmission may be neuroprotective.

The present study examined whether N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists affect the neurophysiological responses of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc; dopaminergic) and pars reticulata (SNpr; non-dopaminergic) neurons to a systemically administered D1 dopamine agonist in two animals models of Parkinson's disease, reserpine treatment and nigrostriatal lesion. 
 Dopamine (DA) and related catechols may contribute to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that differential regional dopamine transporter (DAT) gene expression may underlie the selective vulnerability of certain nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease, DAT mRNA expression was examined in neuronal subpopulations of human postmortem ventral mesencephalon from patients with Parkinson's disease and controls. 
METHODS: Radioactive in situ hybridisation histochemistry using a polymerase chain reaction derived ribonucleotide probe for DAT was performed on sections of ventral mesencephalon from the brains of five donors with no history of neurological illness and from five patients with pathologically established Parkinson's disease. 
In the Parkinson's disease brains, there was an overall decrease in the intensity of DAT mRNA expression in the surviving dopaminergic neurons. 
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings do not support the hypothesis that differential regional DAT gene expression underlies the selective vulnerability of certain nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease, as the vulnerable neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta do not express more DAT mRNA than the resistant paranigral neurons. 
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacodynamics of levodopa among patients with Parkinson's disease showing end-of-dose fluctuations at different doses of entacapone. 
These behavioral and histochemical results may indicate a neuroprotective action of melatonin and suggest a potential pharmacological role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Furthermore, iron, manganese, and alterations in glutathione and CySH metabolism have been implicated in the selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in idiopathic and chemically induced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The aims of this study were to investigate whether the loss of striatal dopamine transporters in early and drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease could be demonstrated by means of 123I-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodoph enyl)tropane (123I-FP-CIT) SPECT in a 1-day protocol and whether the SPECT measures were correlated with disease severity.METHODS: Twenty-one early-stage and drug-naive Parkinson's disease patients (age range 42-73 yr; mean age 55.5 yr) and 14 healthy controls (age range 28-83 yr; mean age 53.6 yr) were examined. 
RESULTS: All striatal 123I-FP-CIT ratios were significantly lower in the Parkinson's disease group compared to those in the control group. 
Patients with unilateral Parkinson's disease showed a bilateral loss of striatal 123I-FP-CIT binding. 
Discriminant function analysis, using the 123I-FP-CIT SPECT data of the ipsilateral and contralateral putamen, predicted group membership in all cases; the contralateral putamen accounted for the greatest difference between the Parkinson's disease patients and the controls. 
Unexpectedly, in the Parkinson's disease group, regression analysis revealed that neither severity of disease nor age accounted for a significant part of the variance in striatal SPECT measures. 
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that 123I-FP-CIT SPECT is a reliable method to discriminate between early, drug-naive Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls and to identify patients in the preclinical phase of Parkinson's disease. 
Possibly due to the relatively homogeneous group of Parkinson's disease patients and the use of a suboptimal outcome measure, no significant correlations were found between striatal 123I-FP-CIT binding ratios and disease severity, such as were established earlier with 123I-beta-CIT. 
 Noradrenergic (NE) neurons belonging to the locus coeruleus (LC), much more than the A1 and A2 areas, are lost in Parkinson's disease (PD).

 An augmented synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinolines, such as salsolinol (SAL) or an increased N-methylation of these compounds has been addressed by various investigators as putative pathophysiologic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Because in the literature bradykinesia and hypokinesia are frequently confounded, we assessed the relation between these two fundamental aspects of altered movement and the influence of disease severity on these measures in 41 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 24 age-matched healthy controls. 
 The effects of dopamine receptor agonists on urinary bladder function were evaluated in normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned parkinsonian cynomolgus monkeys to investigate the therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of urinary symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
These findings suggest that concurrent activation of D1/D2 receptors, rather than selective stimulation of D2 receptors, might be beneficial for treating urinary symptoms caused by detrusor hyperreflexia in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA). 
 A neural network model of movement control in normal and Parkinson's disease (PD) conditions is proposed to simulate the time-varying dose-response relationship underlying the effects of levodopa on movement amplitude and movement duration in PD patients. 
Experimental and neural network simulation data suggest that levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease has differential effects on cell activities, striatal neuropeptides, and motor behavior. 
Here we present a possible reparative intervention applicable to spinal cord injury based on multiple white-to-gray matter peripheral nerve bridge grafts and work based on the specific role of Nurr1 for dopamine neuron development, suggesting that development of ligands to transcription factor might be a new inroad to neuroprotective treatments in Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease. 
Using the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of Parkinson's disease and differential display PCR, we have identified a set of more than 30 genes whose expression rapidly increases in response to stimulation of striatal dopamine D1 receptors. 
 We have evaluated the neuronal uptake of 12 neutral and quaternary azaheterocyclic amines that are possible candidates for idiopathic Parkinson's disease via dopamine transporter of striatal synaptosomes. 
 Sporadic Parkinson's disease is associated with a defect in the activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. 
Pramipexole, a chemically novel dopamine agonist used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms, possesses antioxidant activity and is neuroprotective toward substantia nigral dopamine neurons in hypoxic-ischemic and methamphetamine models. 
These results suggest that pramipexole may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease by attenuating intracellular processes such as oxygen radical generation and the mitochondrial transition pore opening, which are associated with programmed cell death. 
These cholinoceptors would be able to influence the activity of the midbrain dopamine system greatly and may play a role in, and/or be a therapeutic target for, brain disorders in which dopamine is involved (e.g., Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia). 
 Monoamine oxidase (MAO), which exists in two forms (MAOA and MAOB), plays an important role in the oxidative metabolism of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, and has been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with dopamine-replacing agents such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is compromised by many side-effects, most notably involuntary movements, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. 
Acute challenge with dopamine-replacing drugs elicits a rotational response in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
While these rats do not exhibit symptoms of dyskinesia per se, this rodent model does exhibit behaviors, the underlying mechanism of which is likely to be similar to that underlying L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and may prove useful in studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. 
 The cocaine analog beta-CIT is one of the most used compounds for SPET examination of the dopamine transporter in drug abuse and Parkinson's disease. 
It is approved as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with advanced disease experiencing motor effects because of diminished response to levodopa. 
Data from relatively long term (10- or 31-week) studies suggest that pramipexole monotherapy (0.375 to 6.0 mg/day) can improve activities of daily living and motor symptoms in patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
Further studies comparing pramipexole with other dopamine agonists and levodopa in patients with early and advanced Parkinson's disease would be useful. 
The most commonly reported adverse events in pramipexole recipients with advanced disease were orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesias, extrapyramidal syndrome (defined as a worsening of the Parkinson's disease), dizziness, hallucinations, accidental injury, dream abnormalities, confusion, constipation, asthenia, somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormality, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia and urinary frequency. 
The incidence of some adverse events did not greatly differ between pramipexole and placebo recipients.CONCLUSIONS: Pramipexole is effective as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
The efficacy of pramipexole monotherapy in patients with early disease has also been demonstrated, although the use of dopamine agonists in early Parkinson's disease remains controversial. 
 The decrement in dopamine levels exceeds the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and experimental models of PD. 
This suggests that an increase in DA turnover develops early in the disease process and may be one of the compensatory mechanisms partly responsible for the delay in the development of the clinical manifestations in Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa therapy remains the major form of treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The classical role of dopamine agonists in Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy is adjunctive treatment to levodopa once "wearing-off" fluctuations or more malignant types of "on-off" swings have developed. 
 Accurate diagnosis and individualized assessment of the risks and benefits of available antiparkinsonian medications should guide initiation of treatment for patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 As the substantia nigra degenerates in Parkinson's disease (PD), the nigrostriatal pathway is disrupted, reducing striatal dopamine and producing PD symptoms. 
 Striatal dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD), first described in 1960, was a key event that led to the era of levodopa therapy. 
Using the framework of equilibrium point theory of movement, we discuss how a set switching deficit may also underlie clinical motor disturbances seen in Parkinson's disease. 
 Embryonic dopamine neurons survive poorly after transplant into models of Parkinson's disease, possibly due to programmed cell death (apoptosis). 
Prevention of apoptosis with anti-apoptotic agents may improve the viability of dopamine neurons grafted for Parkinson's disease. 
Neurochemical analysis of an autopsied brain showed a pronounced decrease in choline acetyltransferase activity in the frontal and temporal cortices and hippocampus and a severe depletion of striatal dopamine with a pattern not typical of classic Parkinson's disease. 
 The clinical distinction between dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and juvenile Parkinson's disease JPD) can pose a diagnostic challenge. 
(1R)-2beta-Carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-[123I]iodophenyl)tropane ([123I]beta-CIT) is a ligand for the DAT, and it was shown to be a useful nuclear imaging marker for neurons that degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 This study analyzed temporal changes of striatal dopamine-D2 receptor binding during the course of different extrapyramidal movement disorders using 123I-iodobenzamide (IBZM) SPECT.METHODS: Eighteen patients (9 with Parkinson's disease, 9 with parkinsonian plus syndrome) were followed for 11-53 mo. 
Mean specific dopamine-D2 receptor binding was lower in patients with parkinsonian plus syndrome compared to patients with Parkinson's disease on the initial (p < 0.001) as well as the follow-up study (p < 0.001). 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, we observed an unaffected receptor binding compared to a reduced binding of radiotracer in patients with parkinsonian plus syndrome during the course of the disease (p < 0.001). 
CONCLUSION: During the follow-up, patients with Parkinson's disease showed a constant dopamine-D2 receptor binding. 
These findings are in agreement with histopathological data that demonstrated a preserved dopamine-D2 receptor status in patients with Parkinson's disease and a decline of the dopamine-D2 receptors in patients with parkinsonian plus syndrome. 
 A consistent neurochemical abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD) is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra, leading to a reduction of striatal dopamine (DA) levels. 
 In order to verify the presumed dopaminergic basis of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD), we studied olfactory functions in 12 PD patients (mean age 60.1 yrs, mean duration of PD 9.0 yrs, mean Hoehn and Yahr score 2.8) before and after apomorphine (APO) administration. 
 The free radical hypothesis for the pathogenesis and/or progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) has gained wide acceptance in recent years. 
This can at least partly explain why (-)deprenyl should be administered daily to evoke therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease. 
 A leading hypothesis of the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration of the substantia nigra dopamine-containing cells in Parkinson's disease (PD) is excessive oxidative stress. 
 Although neural transplantation holds promise as a treatment for Parkinson's disease, parkinsonian primates have generally exhibited inconsistent and incomplete recovery of motor functions following intrastriatal grafting of fetal ventral mesencephalon. 
 The potential of a novel therapeutic approach for treating Parkinson's disease, which involves the transplantation of a transfected human astrocyte cell line SVG-TH, that stably expresses the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase, was examined. 
SVG-TH and untransfected parent cells were grafted into the diseased striatum of rats in which Parkinson's disease had been induced by the administration of 6-hydroxydopamine. 
Alleviation of symptoms of Parkinson's disease (abnormal movements) was evaluated by rotation tests. 
These findings indicate the potential of treating Parkinson's disease by the intrabrain grafting of human astrocyte cells transfected with the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine production. 
The lateralised nature of the deficit excludes explanation based on global activational changes; rather the unilateral deficit may provide a simple test of unilateral 'rigidity' in a widely used rodent model of Parkinson's disease. 
Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in six patients with moderate Parkinson's disease and in six age-matched control subjects while they performed easy and difficult versions of a modified Tower of London planning task and a mnemonic variant of this task that required short-term retention and reproduction of problem solutions, as well as a control condition that involved identical visual stimuli and motor responses. 
Relative to control conditions, the planning task was associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow centred on the internal segment of the right globus pallidus in the age-matched control subjects, and a decrease in the same region in the patients with Parkinson's disease. 
A similar inverse relationship between the task-specific blood flow change observed in the control group and that observed in the Parkinson's disease patients was not found in any other subcortical or cortical area examined, including regions of the dorsolateral frontal cortex known to be involved in this task. 
We conclude that striatal dopamine depletion disrupts the normal pattern of basal ganglia outflow in Parkinson's disease and consequently, affects the expression of frontal-lobe functions by interrupting normal transmission of information through frontostriatal circuitry. 
The intrinsic properties of the dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) which degenerate during Parkinson's disease are described in detail. 
Recent developments in the field of compensatory mechanisms speak for the urgence to develop a valid chronic model of Parkinson's disease, integrating all the clinical features, even resting tremor, and illustrating the gradual evolution of nigral degeneration observed in human Parkinson's disease. 
 In the 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease in the rat, there is a significant reduction in the number of dendritic spines on the principal projection neurons in the neostriatum, presumably attributable to loss of the nigrostriatal dopamine input. 
 Ropinirole is a novel, nonergoline, selective D2-type dopamine agonist developed to treat Parkinson's disease. 
Second, within the D2 subfamily, it has preferential affinity for the D3 receptor subtype, which, according to preclinical studies, could contribute additional efficacy for treatment of both motor and psychiatric syndromes in Parkinson's disease. 
Pramipexole's demonstrated clinical efficacy for successful treatment in early disease for several years in the absence of L-dopa and as adjunctive therapy with L-dopa in late disease suggests a potential new paradigm for treatment of Parkinson's disease whereby new patients are initiated with pramipexole therapy and L-dopa is added only as necessary. 
 Overactivity of the substantia nigra zona reticulata and the medial segment of the globus pallidus are responsible for the generation of symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
Reducing the activity of these regions has been shown to be a viable alternative to dopamine replacement in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In this study we have shown that intracerebral infusion of the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB 206553 (50 nmol) into the substantia nigra zona reticulata has an antiparkinsonian action in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Hence, 5-HT2C receptor antagonists may be useful adjuncts to dopamine agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Penile erections were regularly induced by intermittent subcutaneous injections of apomorphine in five patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) complicated by motor fluctuations. 
 Striatal dopamine transporter function and dopamine D2 receptor status were evaluated in 15 patients with early untreated Parkinson's disease using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) with 123I-Iodo-2beta-carboxymethoxy-3beta-(4-idiophenyl)tropane (beta-CIT) and 123I-Iodobenzamide (IBZM) as pre- and postsynaptic ligands. 
 We implanted human embryonic mesencephalic tissue into the striatum of 13 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and three patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism. 
 Gene transfer techniques have been explored as therapeutic modalities and neurobiologic tools to understand the role of various genes in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
The pharmacologic profile of GDNF in two well-characterized animal models of Parkinson's disease suggests that the molecule may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases involving dopaminergic dysfunction such as Parkinson's disease. 
This review summarizes the preclinical development path which was taken to develop GDNF as a novel therapeutic approach to treat Parkinson's disease based on GDNF's ability to regenerate dopamine neurons, including a description of the pharmacologic/biologic activities of GDNF. 
The overall aim will be to discuss these issues in the context of their potential therapeutic usefulness of GDNF to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 Oxidative stress may contribute to nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease based on postmortem investigations showing increased iron levels, decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), and impaired mitochondrial function. 
This leads to oxidative damage because lipid peroxidation is increased in substantia nigra and there is a widespread increase in protein and DNA oxidation in the brain in Parkinson's disease. 
Indeed, in Parkinson's disease itself, there is little evidence for nitric oxide's involvement in nigral pathology. 
A susceptibility factor for the development of Parkinson's disease may involve isoforms of cytochrome P450, some of which are found in the brain. 
Oxidative processes clearly contribute to the pathology of Parkinson's disease but are probably secondary to some other primary unidentified cause, presumably genetic or environmental. 
Nevertheless, their involvement may allow therapeutic intervention in the cascade of events associated with the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 We studied myocardial 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) accumulation in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results suggest that the activating effect of repeated ECT on 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (5-HT) and DA neurotransmission, (especially on 5-HT neurotransmission), is significant in improving depression both in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in those who do not suffer from PD. 
 As it had previously been demonstrated that there were reduced brain dopamine concentrations in monkeys who had been given polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) chronically, we hypothesized that organochlorine compounds in general, and PCBs in particular, might be important in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In a study of caudate nucleus obtained post mortem from patients with Parkinson's disease and from controls, there were significantly higher concentrations of the organochlorine insecticide dieldrin and the PCB congener 153 in the PD tissue. 
DDE, PCB congener 180, and total PCBs (matched with a commercial preparation) also tended to be higher in Parkinson's disease tissue. 
We think that this is important preliminary evidence that diorthosubstituted PCBs may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, and a greater presence of organochlorine insecticides in the PD tissue suggests that this may be in part the explanation for the association between PD and rural living. 
 Many studies have previously described changes in preproenkephalin-A (PPE-A) and preproenkephalin-B (PPE-B) gene expression in the striatum of the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease (both with or without dopamine replacement treatment). 
 In Parkinson's disease the cell death of dopamine neurons has been proposed to be mediated by an apoptotic death process, in which nitric oxide may be involved. 
 Neural transplantation is an experimental therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVES: To determine whether continuous waking day dopaminergic stimulation with the dopamine agonist apomorphine can reduce levodopa induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease METHODS: 19 patients with severe unpredictable refractory motor fluctuations and functionally disabling levodopa induced dyskinesias were treated with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine monotherapy for a minimum duration of 2.7 years RESULTS: A mean 65% reduction in dyskinetic severity and a mean 85% reduction in frequency and duration occurred. 
 Although there is no known cure for essential tremor or Parkinson's disease (PD), medical treatment can often significantly reduce or eliminate functional disability. 
We also discuss the role of oxygen-based species in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration and in Parkinson's disease. 
These patients had Parkinson's disease for 5 to 29 years; mean age was 73 years. 
 OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the effects of short-term levodopa administration on motor, cognitive, and psychiatric aspects of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist amantadine on levodopa-associated dyskinesias and motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Increasing evidence indicates that dopamine (DA) transporter density declines in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In this study, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]altropane was used to measure DAT density in seven healthy volunteers (five males, age 37-75, and two females, ages 26 and 39) and eight male patients with Parkinson's disease (age 14-79, Hoehn and Yahr stage: 1.5-3 (n = 5) and 4-5 (n = 3)). 
Accordingly, it is an valuable marker for Parkinson's disease and other pathological states of dopamine neurons. 
We now report the binding properties of [125I]altropane in postmortem tissue of normal human brain and compare the findings to Parkinson's diseased brain. 
In postmortem Parkinson's diseased brain, bound [125I]altropane (1 nM) was markedly reduced (89%, 99% in putamen, depending on measures of nonspecific binding) compared with normal aged-matched controls (normal putamen: 49.2 +/- 8.1 pmol/g; Parkinson's diseased putamen: 0.48 +/- 0.33 pmol/g; n = 4). 
In Parkinson's diseased brains (n = 4), [125I]altropane binding was 13% of the levels detected in normal putamen, 17% of normal values in the caudate nucleus, and 25% of normal levels in nucleus accumbens. 
The association of [125I]altropane to the dopamine transporter in human postmortem tissue, the marked reduction of [125I]altropane binding in Parkinson's diseased brains, its rapid entry into brain and highly localized distribution in dopamine-rich brain regions, support its use as a probe for monitoring the dopamine transporter in vitro and in vivo by SPECT imaging. 
 While the search for environmental neurotoxins as causal factors of Parkinson's disease (PD) continues, we have found no concordance in 1,000 married couples over age 50 in Spain. 
 Tolcapone is a potent, reversible inhibitor of catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) intended for use as an adjunct to levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Parkinson's disease involves the progressive degeneration of these neurons. 
The use of encapsulated dopamine-secreting cells that can be transplanted directly into the striatum has particular appeal for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
This article provides a brief and timely review of the progress that has been made over the past decade using encapsulated PC12 cells as a means of delivering dopamine and L-DOPA to the striatum in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease. 
These results have implications in terms of finding ways to induce patchy growth when grafting to the mature striatum of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: Transplantation of foetal dopaminergic cells has been extensively used as restorative treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, when locomotor activity induced by levodopa was examined on a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, pretreatment of the animals with nonselective doses of deprenyl caused an enhancement of the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. 
The great increase in levodopa responses by deprenyl suggests a likely therapeutic use of this dopamine precursor with a higher dosage of the MAO inhibitor, to reduce effectively the daily levodopa requirements in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Orally administered levodopa remains the most effective symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease symptoms can be improved by transplanting fetal dopamine cells into the putamen of parkinsonian patients. 
Localized damage to parts of the basal ganglia occurs in certain diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on the presence of two or more of the major symptoms: tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia. 
Brain dopamine deficiency is sufficient to explain all of the major symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is still poorly understood. 
Based on our results we suggest that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is susceptible to damage by inflammatory events and that these may be implicated in neurodegeneration processes such as Parkinson's disease. 
 The efficacy and safety of ropinirole, a novel nonergot dopamine D2-like receptor agonist, was assessed as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease. 
In conclusion, ropinirole is a safe and well-tolerated drug and, as monotherapy, provided significant therapeutic benefit compared with placebo to patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
The relation between levodopa plasma concentrations and motor response was examined in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design in 10 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease with end-of-dose motor fluctuations. 
The current study examines the effects of BAM-1110 on parkinsonian symptoms in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys, an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
BAM-1110 appears to be a potentially useful dopamine agonist to treat Parkinson's disease because of its relatively weak drug-induced hyperactive disturbances and anorexic side effects. 
METHODS: This was an open, randomized, two sessions cross over study in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease, comparing the steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of ropinirole on two different study days: 'fasted' and 'fed'. 
Based on these data we suppose that enhancement of DOPA synthesis by ascorbic acid may be useful in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that D2R-deficient mice are not a model of Parkinson's disease. 
These results suggest that THP and its derivatives might be uptaken through DAT and be involved in Parkinson's disease and/or alcohol addiction. 
 Incidence of severe depression is very common in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Low learning rates, which would be hypothesized to reflect low levels of dopamine, as in Parkinson's disease, led to slow acquisition of contextual information. 
Our results indicate that CoQ10 can attenuate the MPTP-induced loss of striatal dopamine and dopaminergic axons in aged mice and suggest that CoQ10 may be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
We evaluated the effect of apomorphine (a potent and rapid dopamine-agonist) on the changes in the peripheral and central silent period in 29 patients with Parkinson's disease and in two patients affected by multisystem atrophy (MSA). 
 We measured CSF and plasma levels of cGMP in 22 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in 28 age and sex-matched controls. 
Abnormally low influx of dopa decarboxylase tracers in the basal ganglia is characteristic of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. 
Consistent with postmortem results, the impaired retention of labelled dopa is more pronounced in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease; this heterogeneity persists after correction for spillover. 
Current in vivo assays of dopa decarboxylase activity fail to discriminate clinically distinct stages in the progression of Parkinson's disease and are, by themselves, insufficient for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and other subcortical movement disorders. 
PC12 cell-containing devices represent one possible strategy for safe transplantation of dopamine-secreting cells for the treatment of dopamine-deficient diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease is often complicated by the development of dyskinetic side effects. 
 A significant body of evidence has been provided to support the hypothesis that oxidant stress may be responsible for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in Parkinson's disease. 
Apomorphine, a dopamine D1/D2-receptor agonist in the clinical therapy of Parkinson's disease, has been found to be a potent antioxidant and to prevent free radical reaction in rat brain mitochondrial fraction. 
 In contrast to levodopa (L-dopa), de novo administration of the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated subhuman primates is not associated with the onset of significant dyskinesia. 
These data illustrate the importance of kappa opioid receptors in the neural mechanisms controlling voluntary movement and suggest that kappa opioid agonists may have a role as adjuncts to dopamine replacement in the management of Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: To review the main landmarks which led to the introduction of levadopa in the the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the impact of levadopatherapy. 
In 1960, Hornykiewiez and Ehringer published a paper on the existence of a marked deficit of dopamine in the caudate nucleus and putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Introduction of levadopa produced a markedly beneficial effect on the course and mortality of Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSION: More than 25 years after the introduction of levadopatherapy, it is still the mainstay of the treatment of Parkinson's disease, in combination with other medical and surgical treatment. 
Brains of patients with Parkinson's disease show depletion of ventral tegmental area mesolimbic-mesocortical neurons. 
The high concentrations of dopamine formed after L-DOPA administration may be the cause of dyskinesias or further oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease. 
 Alterations in the glutathione system and impairment in energy metabolism have both been implicated in the loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 It has been suggested that the excitatory amino acid glutamate, acting as both a neurotoxin and a neurotransmitter, might play a central role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The treatment of Parkinson's disease for most patients entails long term exposure to multiple agents, including anticholinergics, levodopa, amantadine, dopamine receptor agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, selegiline (deprenyl) and clozapine. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease require medication for the control of the motor symptoms of their condition, for related medical or psychiatric symptoms of the disorder, and for concurrent medical problems, such as hypertension or cardiac disease.All these agents may cause adverse effects. 
Clinicians caring for patients with Parkinson's disease must be knowledgable about the potential adverse effects and drug interactions of an expanding array of medications for this condition. 
Lumbar CSF was obtained from 26 patients with Parkinson's disease (15 early and 11 advanced parkinsonism) and from six healthy controls. 
These results suggest that cabergoline has long-acting effects in the marmoset model of parkinsonism, and that it will be a useful agent for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly in cases with fluctuating motor disabilities. 
Because of the neurotrophic properties of guanosine and guanine, changes in striatal concentrations of these purines secondary to increased dopamine (DA) turnover may have relevance for survival of remaining dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Positron emission tomography (PET) and carbon-11-labeled 2B-carbomethoxy-3B-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (11C-CFT or 11-WIN 35,428) were used as molecular markers for striatal presynaptic dopamine (DA) transporters in a unilateral Parkinson's disease rat neurotransplantation model. 
 The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is higher in whites than in nonwhites and it increases with advancing age. 
Patients with early, untreated Parkinson's disease maintained on (-)deprenyl need levodopa significantly later than their placebo-treated peers, and when on levodopa plus (-)deprenyl, they live significantly longer than patients on levodopa alone. 
It may be supposed that a prophylactic low dose administration of a safe catecholaminergic activity enhancer substance during the postdevelopmental phase of life will slow the age-related decline of behavioral performances, delay natural death and decrease susceptibility to Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
 PET (positron emission tomography) has yielded manifest improvements in our knowledge of Parkinson's disease, in terms of pathological and pharmacological aspects. 
Since PET was introduced in study of Parkinson's disease 15 years ago, the technique has been steady refined, and more tracers are becoming available. 
This work should stimulate research on the clinical applicability of carotid body autotransplants in Parkinson's disease. 
Until these trials have been completed (they are planned to last for 3 to 5 years), it will be impossible to know whether the postponement of dopatherapy with ropinirole administration influences the long-term outcome of Parkinson's disease. 
We recorded event-related evoked potentials (ERPs) and reaction time (RT) during a cued priming task in both patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects. 
 Oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter, but it also exerts a neurotoxic effect under certain pathological conditions, including age-related neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease. 
It is likely that a low dose of L-DOPA (normally needed in the treatment of Parkinson's disease) will not affect the results on [99mTc]TRODAT-1 single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging studies. 
This N-methyl(R)salsolinol was found to increase significantly in the cerebrospinal fluid of untreated parkinsonian patients, suggesting its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, the activity of a neutral N-methyltransferase, measured by using (R)salsolinol as a substrate, was found to increase significantly (100.2 +/- 81.8 pmol/min/mg of protein) in comparison with that in controls (18.9 +/- 15.0 pmol/min/mg of protein). 
Increase of the neutral N-methyltransferase may be an endogenous factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 This multicentre randomised double-blind 3- to 5-year trial was designed to assess whether initial therapy with cabergoline alone or in combination with levodopa prevents or delays the occurrence of long term motor complications in patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
Patients eligible for study inclusion (n = 412) had early idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 to 3) and had received no previous treatment with levodopa, selegiline or dopamine agonists. 
In conclusion, the study shows that, in patients with early Parkinson's disease, cabergoline is effective either as monotherapy or combined with levodopa. 
 The clinical efficacy of the long-acting dopamine agonist cabergoline as an adjunct to levodopa has been investigated in controlled and uncontrolled studies in > 1500 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and motor complications. 
 The appearance of late motor complications is the major drawback of long term levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Cabergoline possesses all the prerequisites for testing the hypothesis that steady stimulation of D2 receptors may be able to minimise the development of late motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Initial clinical studies have demonstrated that the efficacy of cabergoline is comparable to that of levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The preliminary results of a long term study of initiation of treatment with cabergoline or levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease are in keeping with the hypothesis that steady receptor stimulation diminishes late motor complications. 
 Levodopa continues to be the most effective agent for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Continuous dopaminergic replacement not only reverses these complications in parkinsonian patients but also prevents their development in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Paraquat has been implicated as an environmental toxin which may induce the syndrome of Parkinson's disease after exposure to this agent.

EPRs may include dystonias, dyskinesias, akathisia, parkinsonism, exacerbations of Parkinson's disease, and possibly the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 
Information from available case reports does not strongly support any consistent risk factor, although some worth considering may include total SSRI daily dose, rapid dose escalation strategies, increased age, female gender, concurrent psychotropics known to also precipitate EPRs, and concurrent disease states such as Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVES: To determine the degree of dopaminergic response of swallowing dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

 As a compound of structural analogy with MPTP, N-methyl-norsalsolinol (2-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline; 2-MDTIQ) was recently identified in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Previous studies of the dopamine metabolism in Parkinson's disease have demonstrated an increased dopamine turnover in the presence of 2-MDTIQ. 
Thus, 2-MDTIQ is suggested not only to represent an endogenous marker of Parkinson's disease, but also to support changes in the transmitter synthesis of dopaminergic neurons. 
2-MDTIQ may represent an essential factor in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease.

 Current hypotheses of basal ganglia dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) propose that neuronal hypoactivity in the globus pallidus externus (GPe), and hyperactivity in the output nuclei and the external and internal portions of the globus pallidus internus (GPi,e and GPi,i, respectively), result in the cardinal symptoms of PD. 
 Motor fluctuations associated with levodopa therapy are common problems encountered in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of [123I]epidepride-SPECT for the differential diagnosis of movement disorders.METHODS: SPECT imaging with a triple-headed scintillation camera was performed in 9 patients with Parkinson's disease, 9 patients with probable multiple system atrophy (MSA), 1 patient with progressive supranuclear palsy, 16 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and 14 controls, 3 hr after the intravenous injection of 3.7 +/- 1.3 mCi of [123I]epidepride. 
The striatum-to-cerebellum ratio - 1 was significantly reduced in MSA (11.8 +/- 3.9, compared to controls, 19.0 +/- 6.3; p < 0.01) and in patients with HD (8.8 +/- 3.2; p < 0.00005) but normal in Parkinson's disease (15.8 +/- 3.6; not significant). 
The use of various cortical reference regions did not improve discrimination between MSA and controls or Parkinson's disease patients, respectively. 
Transporter concentrations have been known to decrease in Parkinson's disease patients. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of IPT as an imaging agent for measuring changes in transporter concentrations in Parkinson's disease.METHODS: IPT labeled with 6.78 +/- 0.67 mCi 123I was injected intravenously as a bolus into eight normal controls (mean age 41 +/- 12 yr) and 17 Parkinson's disease patients (mean age 55 +/- 9 yr). 
RESULTS: The mean (BG-OCC)/OCC ratio for normal controls (3.07 +/- 0.73) was significantly higher than that for Parkinson's disease patients at 115 min (1.10 +/- 0.56) (p = 2.76 x 10[-5]). 
The mean R(V) and R(A) for Parkinson's disease patients were 0.78 +/- 0.31 and 0.65 +/- 0.24, respectively. 
Both R(V) and R(A) for normal controls were significantly higher than those for Parkinson's disease patients (p values for R(V) and R(A) were 1.91 x 10(-8) and 3.46 x 10(-10), respectively). 
CONCLUSION: The R(V), R(A) and (BG-OCC)/OCC for Parkinson's disease patients were clearly separated from those of normal controls, and they may be useful outcome measures for clinical diagnosis.

 A 65-year-old woman with chronic pain was admitted to the hospital for severe recurrent major depression complicating Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These results show that administration of L-DOPA/ carbidopa not only raises dopamine levels but can also affect other biochemicals and that the observed changes in amino acids and related compounds can perhaps contribute to the beneficial and/or adverse effects of L-DOPA/carbidopa therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
In addition, mutant mice were resistant to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP, a toxin that induces a condition reminiscent of Parkinson's disease. 
 Based on a number of lines of evidence, we have proposed recently that a very early step in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease might be elevated translocation of L-cysteine into neuromelanin-pigmented dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra.

 BACKGROUND: Hallucinosis is a complication of the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease commonly thought to afflict older, chronically medicated, cognitively impaired patients. 
However, patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of short duration experiencing hallucinosis on relatively low doses of dopaminergic medication have been found. 
The aim, therefore, was to investigate the homogeneity of a population of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and hallucinosis. 
METHODS: The clinical, demographic, and cognitive correlates of hallucinosis were investigated in a sample of 129 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
RESULTS: There were two subgroups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease experiencing hallucinosis. 
In patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of longer than five years duration, hallucinosis was associated with postural instability, global cognitive impairment, and lack of depressive affect. 
In all patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, hallucinosis was more prevalent when they were treated with a direct acting dopamine receptor agonist. 
Hallucinosis was not associated with age at onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease or dosage of dopaminergic medication. 
CONCLUSION: Hallucinosis in idiopathic Parkinson's disease is heterogeneous, falling into two groups.

The COMT inhibitors, tolcapone and entacapone, improve the pharmacokinetics of levodopa by preventing its peripheral catabolism and increasing the concentration of brain dopamine; thus, these agents may reduce the incidence of "wearing-off" effects associated with the short half-life of levodopa and the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
CONCLUSIONS: Interim 6-month analyses of pramipexole, ropinirole, and cabergoline for symptomatic treatment of early Parkinson's disease have shown these drugs to be efficacious and relatively well-tolerated when used as monotherapy. 
In advanced stages of Parkinson's disease, these medications were also efficacious; however, the main adverse effects included dyskinesias, somnolence, and hallucinations. 
 Neural tissue transplantation has become an alternative treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. 
The clinical use of neural grafts as a source of dopamine for Parkinson's disease patients, although beneficial, is associated with logistical and ethical issues. 
CONCLUSION: Tolcapone shows promise as an effective adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 Intracranial implantation of polymer-encapsulated PC-12 cells has been shown to improve motor behavioral performance in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, these data suggest that polymer-encapsulated PC-12 cells can store, reuptake, and functionally replenish dopamine and therefore, may be an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 Bromocriptine (BCT) is a dopamine D2 receptor agonist used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinemic disorders.

 Iodine-123-beta-CIT has been used as a probe of dopamine transporters in Parkinson's disease patients using SPECT. 
We studied the test/retest reproducibility of SPECT measures in Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls obtained after injection of [123I])beta-CIT in part to assess the utility of this tracer for longitudinal evaluation of striatal dopamine transporters as a marker of disease progression.METHODS: Seven Parkinson's disease patients and seven healthy control subjects participated in two [123I]beta-CIT SPECT scans separated by 7-21 days. 
RESULTS: The two outcome measures demonstrated excellent test/retest reproducibility for both the Parkinson's disease and healthy subject groups with variability of striatal V3" = 16.8 +/- 13.3% and percent striatal uptake = 6.8 +/- 3.4% for Parkinson's disease patients and V3" = 12.8 +/- 8.9% and %SSU = 7.0 +/- 3.9% for control subjects. 
There were no statistically significant differences in test/retest variability between control subjects and Parkinson's disease patients for either outcome measure. 
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SPECT imaging performed at 24 hr postinjection of [123I]beta-CIT permits calculation of reliable and reproducible measures of dopamine transporters in both Parkinson's disease patients and control subjects and supports the feasibility of using [123I]beta-CIT in the evaluation of disease progression in Parkinson's disease.

We examined ten healthy subjects and 33 de novo patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using [123I]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([123I]beta-CIT) SPET. 
Our findings suggest that reactive oxygen species and dopamine oxidation products can modify glutamate transport function, which may have implications for neurodegenerative processes such as ischemia, methamphetamine-induced toxicity, and Parkinson's disease. 
 Overactivity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
The present study tests this hypothesis by using in vivo extracellular single unit recording techniques to measure neuronal activity in the STN of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway (a model of Parkinson's disease). 
These findings support the premise that therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is associated with a decrease in the activity of the STN, but challenge assumptions about the roles of D1 and D2 receptors in the regulation of neuronal activity of the STN in both the intact and dopamine-depleted states. 
 Sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) may arise from a defect in complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), transmitted through mitochondrial DNA mutations. 
 Early diagnosis is important for satisfactory pharmacotherapy of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Moreover, disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and the mind have to be considered and treated besides pharmacotherapy of motor symptoms in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Both the striatal 18F-dopa uptake and brain glucose metabolism were studied by PET with 6-L-[18F]fluorodopa (FD) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in 9 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 15 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In Parkinson's disease the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway degenerates, resulting in an imbalance in activity of two pathways of information flow through the basal ganglia. 
These results implicate that hormonal modulation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity may represent an important variable responsible for the sex differences which are reported in Parkinson's disease. 
 The initial treatment of Parkinson's disease should be addressed to improve symptoms, slow down the progression of the illness and avoid long and short term complications. 
Amantadine may be a useful drug for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease when symptoms are not severe. 
Selegiline, a MAOB inhibitor with a possible neuroprotective effect, should also be considered as initial option for Parkinson's disease. 
Measurements deriving from FD PET have direct lineal relationship to the nigral cell count in normal ageing and in Parkinson's disease (PD), although in PD the progression of the decline in nigrostriatal dopaminergic function is faster than the controls. 
 The neurochemistry of Parkinson's disease and other degenerative parkinsonisms is reviewed, emphasizing the changes described in the dopaminergic system. 
While in Parkinson's disease D1 and D2 receptors remain preserved as compared to controls, in progressive supranuclear palsy there is a loss of nigral D1 receptors and of striatal D2 receptors. 
A hypothesis of a possible "non-linearity" of FDOPA kinetics with dopaminergic cell losses is presented to explain apparent discrepancies in post-mortem biochemical and histological determinations in Parkinson's disease. 
 We have carried out single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy centered on the putamen both ipsilateral and contralateral to the worst affected side in nine subjects with drug naive idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD); seven chronically levodopa-treated dyskinetic IPD subjects; and 11 age-matched healthy controls. 
 The clinical utility of dopamine (DA) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear. 
 A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 6-month study assessed the efficacy and safety of ropinirole, a nonergoline D2-dopamine agonist, in patients with early Parkinson's disease (n = 241; Hoehn & Yahr stages I to III) with limited or no prior dopaminergic therapy. 
Ropinirole monotherapy is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for treatment of early Parkinson's disease. 
These findings might contribute to the development of new neuroprotective therapies for patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

 To explore new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease, we studied the possible protective effect of an immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A (CsA), treatment on changes in dopaminergic function in rats with intrastriatal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). 
Data from studies in animal models of Parkinson's disease suggest that it is realistic to believe that these approaches might have antiparkinsonian efficacy comparable to those of currently available dopamine-replacing agents and might not be associated with debilitating dyskinetic side-effects after prolonged treatment. 
 We review recent reports suggesting that use of selective serotonergic agents that either inhibit synaptic reuptake or have specific serotonin receptor affinities may benefit a variety of motor disturbances in Parkinson's disease. 
The complex, mixed motoric effects of these agents in Parkinson's disease have not allowed for a consistent view on the interrelationship between dopamine and serotonin (5HT) in motor control but may speak to the nature of dysregulated neurotransmission in the disease. 
 Selegiline is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) at a dose of 10 mg/day and is given to patients with Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa therapy. 
Some studies show that the vulnerability of nigral neurons in Parkinson's disease is correlated to their toxic NM content, while others suggest that it contributes to cellular protection. 
Our findings support a possible role of NM in the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neural degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 The implantation of fetal nigral tissue into the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease is a promising approach to treatment which may produce clinical benefit partly by influencing drug responsiveness. 
Competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists as well as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) antagonists potentiate the stimulatory responses to threshold doses of L-DOPA or the mixed dopamine D-1/D-2 agonist apomorphine in this model, indicating the potential of such combinations for the management of Parkinson's disease.

Moclobemide) and Parkinson's disease (inh. 
 Evidence indicates that the antipsychotic drug clozapine has a low propensity for the induction of extrapyramidal motor symptoms, and also that clozapine has therapeutic effects in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, an electrophysiological approach, which can give basic information regarding the actions of direct and indirect DA receptor agonists on the dopaminergic neurones, might be relevant for the evolution of the pharmacological strategies in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neurologic movement disorder affecting nearly 1% of the population over age 65. 
 The effect of selegiline (L-deprenyl) on plasma catecholamines, clinical response, and drug tolerability was studied in 13 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with L-Dopa/benserazide and entacapone, a peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. 
 Levodopa, which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, has known cytotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons grown in culture. 
 The use of dopamine agonists as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) allows for reduction or limitation of the levodopa dose, potentially delaying the onset or reducing the severity of late motor complications.

 It is suggested that oxidant stress is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 A number of unresolved issues complicate the effective management of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Apoptosis induced by neurotoxins may be a mechanism underlying the cell death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease. 
Indeed, degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway leads to Parkinson's disease in humans, characterized by a strong reduction of released dopamine. 
Moreover, it has been suggested that the pathomechanism of Parkinson's disease involves excitotoxic processes and that treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists might also slow the progression of neurodegeneration. 
Additional preclinical and clinical experiments need to be completed with well tolerated glutamate antagonists to determine the full potential of glutamate receptor blockade as a long-term strategy against levodopa-related motor response complications in Parkinson's disease.

 Both Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and Parkinson's disease are associated with decreased brain dopamine, yet each disorder is characterized by a different set of motor symptoms. 
The main aim of the review is to provide a phylogenetic perspective which may serve as a useful tool to study Parkinson's disease in rodents. 
 In Parkinson's disease, the tonic inhibition by basal ganglia output structures may be exacerbated by the action of the subthalamic nucleus. 
The findings of receptor binding studies supporting an increased neuronal activity of efferents of the subthalamic nucleus in patients with Parkinson's disease, suggest that subthalamic nucleotomy or pallidotomy may be effective lesions in the neurosurgical treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Systemic administration of glutamate antagonists has been shown to have anti-akinetic effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
Glutamate antagonists may therefore be able to retard the progression and to improve the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, glutamate antagonists are useful in the treatment of the akinetic parkinsonian crisis, a severe form of clinical deterioration in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In animal models of Parkinson's disease all these NMDA receptor antagonists counteract parkinsonian symptoms or act synergistically with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). 
 Chronic treatment with dopaminergic agonists is associated with response fluctuations to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine in Parkinson's disease and enhanced motor activity to D1 and D2 dopamine agonists in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway. 
 BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that is difficult to distinguish from other parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple-system atrophy (MSA). 
Differentiation of idiopathic Parkinson's disease from MSA is important because prognosis, complications, and response to therapy vary according to disorder. 
Our aim was to find out whether clonidine/growth hormone (GH) testing distinguishes idiopathic Parkinson's disease from MSA. 
We investigated the effects of clonidine on 14 people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (without autonomic deficits). 
FINDINGS: Clonidine raised serum GH concentrations in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (median increase 8.98 [IQR 6.6-16.6] mU/L), normal participants (13.2 [7.0-18.6] mU/L), and patients with pure autonomic failure (12.5 [5.6-18.2] mU/L). 
The GH response to clonidine in idiopathic Parkinson's disease was significantly different from that in MSA-P (p < 0.0002). 
INTERPRETATION: The GH responses to clonidine clearly differentiated idiopathic Parkinson's disease from MSA-C and MSA-P. 
This phenotype has analogies with Parkinson's disease symptoms.

The results suggest that adenosine A2, but not A1, receptor antagonists may be of potential use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a known neurotoxicant primarily selective for catecholaminergic neurons, including those of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, thereby mimicking the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The neuroprotective effects of (R)-HA-966 and (S)-HA-966 (3-amino-1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone) were examined in an MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that excitatory mechanisms of neurodegeneration are involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, and that strychnine-insensitive glycine site NMDA antagonists may serve as dopaminoprotective agents which intervene in the progressive neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
In particular, the DAT is depleted in Parkinson's disease, and the extent of depletion correlates with the loss of dopamine.

 Intrastriatal grafting of dopamine-rich embryonic ventral mesencephalon (VM) is a potential therapeutic treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study, we tested the ability of astrocytes retrovirally transduced to produce recombinant brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to enhance the survival and/or function of embryonic VM in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat, a well-characterized rodent model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Pramipexole is a dopamine receptor agonist that has proved effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We assessed the role of four candidate genes encoding proteins involved in dopaminergic transmission, the dopamine transporter (DAT), the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), and the main catabolic enzymes of dopamine, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and B (MAOB), through allelic association studies in a population of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD).

These results expand our knowledge about the beneficial effect of deprenyl in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons is the major pathogenic substrate of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Studies of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism in monkeys suggest that excessive inhibitory outflow from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) suppresses the motor thalamus, which reduces activation of the cerebral cortex motor system, resulting in the slowness and poverty of movement of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Endogenous excitotoxins have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The strategy of neuronal protection by increasing the brain kynurenic acid may be useful in retarding cell loss in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases where excitotoxic mechanisms have been implicated. 
 Different groups worldwide have observed in recent years that stereotactic implantation of fetal tissue can ameliorate the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

 Intrastriatal grafting of embryonic dopamine-containing neurons is a promising approach for treating clinical and experimental Parkinson's disease. 
Mild dopamine depletions that were not detectable behaviorally at the time of the insult became clearly evident 10 months after the lesion with this bar-pressing task, and this may represent a more clinically relevant rodent model of Parkinson's disease.

Selected compounds were tested in vivo in the 6-OHDA rodent model of Parkinson's disease and for their liability to produce seizure-like activities in mice. 
Thus, the combined treatment of fetal cerebral cortex with BDNF and dopamine created long-lived TH-expressing neuronal populations which were very effective in alleviating the rat parkinsonian model, and thus may be suitable for use in transplantation in treating human Parkinson's disease. 
the neurodegenerative processes underlying Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 New possibilities in the medical treatment of Parkinson's disease are offered by the MAO-B inhibitor, selegiline, and L-dopa preparations with strongly accelerated or retarded kinetics.

Benign essential tremor and arteriosclerotic pseudo-parkinsonism can easily be confused with Parkinson's disease. 
The cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown. 
Parkinson's disease is the one neurodegenerative disorder in which drugs have been demonstrated to be of value. 
 L-Dopa has long been the mainstay of therapy for Parkinson's disease but its long-term shortcomings, principally uncoordinated, spasmodic or irregular movements (dyskinesias) and fluctuating control of motor symptoms (on/off fluctuations), are well documented. 
In addition, Parkinson's disease is commonly thought to be caused by the neurotoxic effects of an unidentified agent but recent data indicate a greater genetic component than previously recognized. 
Developments in the genetics of Parkinson's disease may provide the key to the next generation of therapeutics. 
 Guidelines for clinical transplantation studies for Parkinson's disease emphasize that transplants should be considered as an adjunct to systemic L-DOPA, yet few preclinical studies have specifically assessed the potential of transplants as an adjunct to the clinical gold standard treatment. 
 In order to evaluate the efficacy of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in a model of advanced Parkinson's disease, we studied rats with extensive bilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway. 
These results suggest that intracerebroventricular GDNF administration improves motor ability and supports nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in a model of severe Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa is the most efficacious and widely used symptomatic drug for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In animal models of Parkinson's disease, transplanted fetal mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons can innervate the dopamine-depleted host brain, but it is unclear why large portions of the host striatum are left uninnervated. 
We report here that rats with grafts into the DA-depleted substantia nigra, that receive cyclosporine A, can experience recovery on spontaneous behaviors that mimic those observed in Parkinson's disease. 
These findings may have important implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition that causes considerable disability in the elderly. 
These results suggest that in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, the neurotrophic factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor reverses behavioural consequences of 6-hydroxydopamine administration, an effect that may involve both dopaminergic and peptidergic neurotransmission. 
The dopamine transporter is involved in the uptake of toxins generating Parkinson's disease; it is also an important target for psychostimulant drugs, ligands for in vivo imaging and medications used for neurologic diseases involving changes in the dopamine system. 
These results also suggest that passive mechanisms involved in the regulation of extracellular dopamine play an important role in maintaining function during the preclinical or presymptomatic phase of Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area regulate movement and affective behavior and degenerate in Parkinson's disease. 
These results suggest that putative Nurr1 ligands may be useful for treatment of Parkinson's disease and other disorders of midbrain dopamine circuitry. 
 Complex I dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and in the neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which produces a Parkinsonian syndrome in experimental animals and humans. 
Certain other pharmacological effects of pergolide, such as reduction of dopamine turnover and effects on free radical scavenging enzymes, may be relevant in the early treatment of Parkinson's disease but this has not been conclusively determined. 
Short and long term noncomparative studies show that pergolide is an effective adjunct to levodopa therapy in patients with advancing Parkinson's disease, reducing the adverse effects of long term levodopa monotherapy and often enabling a reduction in levodopa dosage. 
Studies evaluating the efficacy of pergolide as monotherapy early in the course of Parkinson's disease have shown the drug to be effective, but opinion is divided as to the value of early treatment with dopamine agonists (as opposed to levodopa monotherapy). 
Thus, pergolide is an effective adjunct to levodopa therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and may have a role in the treatment of early disease if its postulated beneficial effects on disease progression are proven. 
PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES: Pergolide is a semisynthetic ergoline dopamine agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
One theory regarding the cause of Parkinson's disease is that metabolism of dopamine produces free radicals which damage nigral neurons. 
Mean steady-state pergolide plasma concentrations of 0.0275 to 1.167 μg/L were recorded during treatment with pergolide 2.25 to 9 mg/day in patients with Parkinson's disease; extensive interpatient variability was noted.

 Unlike the situation in patients with most other degenerative neurological disorders, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and their physicians have a wide range of effective symptomatic drugs at their disposal. 
 Since the discovery that the loss of the dopaminergic innervation of the striatum resulted in Parkinson's disease, physiologists have attempted to understand the role of dopamine on striatal activity. 
 The fact that CYP2D6 is not only expressed in liver but also in brain and the clinical association of this cytochrome with Parkinson's disease suggests the possibility of existence of some endogenous substrate, and among these perhaps one or more neurotransmitters could be metabolized by CYP2D6. 
 BACKGROUND: In a hospital based case-control study, we investigated the role of environmental factors in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. 
METHODS: The smoking histories of 380 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients recruited from nine German clinics were compared to those of age- and sex-matched control subjects (379 neighbourhood controls and 376 controls from the same region). 
In conclusion, PPE-B may contribute to the development of behavioral supersensitivity following repeated dopamine-replacement therapy in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine deficiency is found in both chronic cocaine abusers and Parkinson's disease. 
Question was whether or not she was complicated by Parkinson's disease. 
Previous in vivo imaging and postmortem binding studies have detected a loss in striatal DAT binding in Parkinson's diseased (PD) brain; however, these techniques have poor spatial resolution and may suffer from nonspecific binding of some ligands. 
 Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders are frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease, manifesting mainly as dysphagia, disorders of gastric emptying and constipation. 
 Groups of patients with Parkinson's disease, either medicated or unmedicated, were compared with a matched group of normal control subjects on a computerized battery of tests designed to assess spatial, verbal and visual working memory. 
Medicated Parkinson's disease patients with severe clinical symptoms were impaired on all three tests of working memory. 
Taken together, the findings suggest that working memory deficits in Parkinson's disease emerge, and subsequently progress, according to a defined sequence, the evolution of which may be linked to the likely spatiotemporal progression of dopamine depletion within the striatum, in relation to the terminal distribution of its cortical afferents. 
This enzyme could be central to dopamine neurotoxicity as well as contribute to the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. 
 The ability of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist (5aR,11bS)-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-aza cyclopent-1-ena[c]-phenanthrene-9,10-diol (A-86929) to induce contralateral rotation after repeated administration was determined in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease. 
This study suggests that a selective D1 receptor agonist, such as A-86929, with full intrinsic activity relative to dopamine, may be useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study [123I]IPT SPET was performed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to analyse the relationship between specific dopamine tansporter binding and clinical features of the disease.

 The influence of tolcapone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyl transferase, was evaluated on the disposition of apomorphine, a dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinson's disease, to explain a previously observed increase of duration of the effect of apomorphine associated with tolcapone. 
First, although parkinsonism is known to be preceded by depressive episodes, particularly in a subgroup of younger patients, the symptoms of the elderly patient whose Parkinson's disease is foreshadowed by depression can mimic depressive pseudodementia, potentially leading to diagnostic confusion. 
Finally, depressive pseudodementia in Parkinson's disease does not necessarily herald the development of organic dementia in the long term. 
Free urinary dopamine (and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) concentrations were much higher in the urine of patients treated with L-DOPA for Parkinson's disease than in healthy volunteers. 
 Using unbiased quantitative techniques, we evaluated the effect of Parkinson's disease on the regional size and the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-producing neurons and all neurons in the midbrain A8 and A10 dopaminergic cell groups located adjacent to the substantia nigra. 
Seven patients with Lewy body Parkinson's disease were evaluated and compared with five controls. 
Four of the patients with Parkinson's disease had additional neuropathology, and the effect of concomitant pathology on A10 populations was also determined. 
The parabrachial pigmented nucleus situated dorsal to the substantial nigra, and the parapeduncular nucleus located rostromedially were significantly reduced by 40-50% in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In this review we have focused on the use of ex vivo gene transfer techniques in Parkinson's disease models; however, the issues and approaches outlined are applicable to other neurodegenerative disorders. 
We describe herein different vector systems that are currently available and briefly review the various cell types that have been transduced and grafted into the striatum of animals with experimental Parkinson's disease. 
The strategies for application of gene therapy techniques to a treatment for Parkinson's disease have expanded beyond the classical dopamine replacement toward the use of neurotrophic factors in enhancing cell function or preventing cell death. 
In addition, we explore the utility of CNS-derived neural progenitors as alternative cell types for ex vivo gene therapy in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
 As an aid in the development of vector systems for use in gene therapy paradigms of central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease, we have developed L-Dopa or dopamine-producing gene cassettes. 
These constructs, in conjunction with viral or nonviral expression systems, may be efficacious in gene therapy approaches to Parkinson's disease. 
These vector systems are being evaluated in models of Parkinson's disease. 
The introduction of functional genes into the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease may, for example, prove useful as a means to replace a defective gene, introduce a potentially neuroprotective or neurorestorative protein, or permit the physiological delivery of a deficient neurotransmitter. 
In parkinsonian models was well as in patients with Parkinson's disease, continuous dopaminergic replacement tends to prevent or alleviate these adverse effects. 
Clinical study of these approaches could also serve as initial, relatively simple, proof-of-principle evaluations of the safety and efficacy of genetic approaches to the treatment of basic disease processes in Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. 
 For the past 15 years, patients with Parkinson's disease have participated in clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of intrastriatal dopamine transplants. 
 Most new pharmacological therapies in Parkinson's disease focus on the dopaminergic system. 
 For the past 30 years levodopa (LD) has been the pharmacologic standard of care for treating idiopathic parkinsonism (Parkinson's disease or PD), a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. 
Special consideration is given to biochemical changes that occur in the nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease and how gene therapy may provide a new strategy for reversing parkinsonian biochemical deficits. 
In animal models of Parkinson's disease, loss of the ventral mesencephalic dopamine projection to the striatum has been shown to alter the expression of several striatal peptides, neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes and receptors. 
 Early events in signal information transduction beyond dopamine, beta-adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors, involving receptor-coupled G-protein function and G alpha subunit immunoreactive levels were measured in mononuclear leukocytes (MNLs) of 12 never-treated patients with Parkinson's disease in comparison with 10 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. 
Both beta-adrenergic and dopamine receptor-coupled Gs protein function as measured by cholera toxin-sensitive, isoproterenol- and dopamine-induced increases in Gpp(NH)p-binding capacity, in MNLs of patients with Parkinson's disease were found to be significantly reduced in comparison with those in the control group. 
Muscarinic receptor-coupled non-Gs (Gi or G(o)) protein function: pertussis toxin-sensitive, carbamylcholine-induced increase in Gpp(NH)p-binding capacity, was not found to be significantly different between patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. 
MNL levels of the 45-kDa species of G alpha s were found to be significantly reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease in comparison with control subjects. 
Other non-Gs proteins (Gi, Gq) did not show any significant quantitative differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. 
The reductions in G alpha s levels in MNLs of patients with Parkinson's disease may explain the beta-adrenergic and dopamine receptor-coupled Gs protein hypofunction detected in MNLs of these patients. 
As previous studies have failed to observe significant changes in receptor levels in MNLs of patients with Parkinson's disease, our findings of reduced dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled Gs function and of G alpha s immunoreactive levels in MNLs of Parkinson's patients point to alterations distal to these receptors at the level of the signal-transducing Gs protein. 
 We tested the effects of clozapine, and "atypical" neuroleptic with high affinity for the D4 (dopaminergic), and the 5-HT1c and 5-HT2 (serotonergic) receptor subtypes on locomotor activity in an animal model of Parkinson's disease showing a bimodal response curve to increasing doses of a D2 agonist. 
Additionally, the behavioral tests described here could provide important adjuncts for assessing therapies in this animal analog of human Parkinson's disease. 
 The severity of parkinsonian motor disability and dyskinesias was evaluated in seven levodopa-responsive patients with Parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine, before and after low-dose clozapine (50 mg) for 18 +/- 2 days.

These results confirm the sensitivity of visuospatial memory even at an early stage of Parkinson's disease and suggest the implication of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and associated striato-frontal neuronal circuits, in executive processes needed for spatial location learning. 
The present findings suggest that amantadine may be a valuable tool to investigate the physiological role of 60 kDa calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isozyme in the progression of Parkinson's disease and gives a new insight into the action of this drug. 
The data also suggest that adenosine A2A receptor antagonists might be useful for potentiating the effects of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease. 
 In a 59-year-old male with a 10 year history of Parkinson's disease, progressive movement disorders occurred under medical treatment (end-of-dose akinesia and peak-dose dyskinesia). 
The accumulation of these neurotoxins in the nigro-striatal region might account for selective cell death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease affects mainly the elderly population and is characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural abnormalities. 
Such findings may have bearing on the loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease, in which mitochondrial deficiencies have been identified, but would only be relevant if the selective vulnerability were maintained in vivo.

 The assessment and management of the patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease is complicated by multisystem involvement and variability in symptom presentation and severity. 
Lastly, the heterogeneous patterns of DA uptake within SNc and VTA were consistent with the pattern of degeneration in Parkinson's disease; less vulnerable DA cells, e.g., those in VTA, have less DA uptake than the more vulnerable cells of caudal SNc. 
The potential relevance of the in vitro chemistry described in this and earlier reports to reaction that might occur in neuromelanin-pigmented dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 OBJECTIVES: The main neuropathological feature in Parkinson's disease is a severe degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in a loss of dopamine (DA) transporters in the striatum. 
[123I]beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies have demonstrated this loss of striatal DA transporter content in Parkinson's disease in vivo. 
Recently, a new radioligand [123I]FP-CIT, with faster kinetics than beta-CIT, became available for imaging of the DA transporter with SPECT, and the applicability of this ligand was tested in patients with early and advanced Parkinson's disease, using a one day protocol. 
METHODS: [123I]FP-CIT SPECT was performed in six patients with early and 12 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and in six age matched healthy volunteers. 
RESULTS: Compared with an age matched control group striatal [123I]FP-CIT uptake in patients with Parkinson's disease was decreased, and this result was measurable three hours after injection of the radioligand. 
In the Parkinson's disease group the uptake in the putamen was reduced more than in the caudate nucleus. 
The contralateral striatal uptake of [123I]FP-CIT was significantly lower than the ipsilateral striatal uptake in the Parkinson's disease group. 
A subgroup of patients with early Parkinson's disease also showed significantly lower uptake in the putamen and lower putamen:caudate ratios than controls. 
CONCLUSION: [123I]FP-CIT SPECT allows a significant discrimination between patients with Parkinson's disease and age matched controls with a one day protocol, which will be to great advantage in outpatient evaluations. 
With regard to potential treatments of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease chromaffin cell grafting can be used as one therapeutical approach. 
 To determine if the combination of levodopa (LD) plus bromocriptine (Br) in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) permits reduction of LD dosage and consequently results in fewer motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, a double-blind, multicenter prospective study in 50 PD patients who had responded favorably to LD while under treatment with that drug for < or = 6 months was undertaken. 
 Alterations in the number or functional state of D2 dopamine receptors have been implicated in the decreased motor abilities associated with normal aging, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

 This paper provides a critical review on the most recent developments in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Protective therapy, which will attract the interest of fundamental and clinical research in the field of Parkinson's disease, is the real future challenge. 
By careful selection of the dose and placement of the toxin it is possible to obtain reproducible and regionally defined partial lesions which are well correlated with stable functional deficits, not only in drug-induced behaviors but also in spontaneous motoric and sensorimotoric function, which are analogous to the symptoms seen in patients during early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
These results are discussed with respect to the neural mechanisms determining deficits and recovery after such dopamine lesions and their relevance to similar clinical phenomena, namely Parkinson's disease. 
 We consider whether chemical pollutants in drinking water (including aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, and phthalic acid) or used occupationally in agriculture that have shown no parkinsonism-inducing effect may be responsible for excess cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) in three adjacent kibbutzim in southern Israel (Negev).

 A 9-year nationwide study of bromocriptine monotherapy and combination therapy with bromocriptine and levodopa in Parkinson's disease is reported. 
 L-DOPA, the precursor of dopamine, remains most effective in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease, but prolonged L-DOPA treatment often produces adverse effects, including dyskinesia and psychosis. 
For better treatment of Parkinson's disease, it is important to solve these problems. 
Juvenile parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease are also striatal dopamine deficiency, but no mutation in the enzyme has not been found, and they are supposed to be different from HPD/DRD in which no cell death of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons occurs.

 Since 1992 there has been renewed interest in pallidotomy now that the limitations and adverse effects of long-term dopaminergic therapy have become more apparent and more difficult to control in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
The authors describe the effect of pallidotomy in 19 patients, sixteen of whom had advanced Parkinson's disease with painful dystonia and/or response fluctuations with severe akinesia while in "off" and dyskinesias while in "on". 
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that gabapentin improves rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor of parkinsonism including both Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's syndrome. 
 The combination of levodopa and a dopamine agonist in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease often reduces the severity of motor fluctuations. 
We report 3 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations who received high doses of pergolide without levodopa resulting in a reduction of motor fluctuations. 
 The effects of tolcapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, on the bioavailability and efficacy of levodopa were evaluated in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 8 of whom showed signs of daily motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon). 
Previous studies have shown that the dopaminergic deficit in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can clearly be visualized and quantified using this method. 
This isoquinoline induced parkinsonism in rat after injection in the striatum, and the behavioral, biochemical and pathological changes were very similar to those in Parkinson's disease. 
All these results suggest that N-methyl-(R)salsolinol may be an endogenous neurotoxin to cause Parkinson's disease and the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis and catabolism may be endogenous factors in the pathogenesis of this disease. 
 Parkinsonism is most of the time caused by idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). 
 Inhibitors of the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) may be useful adjuncts to L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease as they offer the possibility of increasing the availability of the amino acid. 
 The involvement of abdominal afferent vagal activity and serotonergic mechanisms were examined following intravenous administration of talipexole, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist used for treatment of Parkinson's disease, in anesthetized rats. 
One of the possible reason why talipexole showed fewer emetic side effects in patients with Parkinson's disease may be that the emetic responses triggered by D2 receptor stimulation may secondarily cause an increase of abdominal afferent vagal activity, which may be weakened by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonistic property of talipexole. 
 Loss of striatal dopamine (DA) transporters in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been accurately assessed in vivo by single-photon emission tomography (SPET) studies using [123I]beta-CIT. 
In the midbrain, calbindin is preferentially expressed in those dopamine neurons which are spared from degeneration in Parkinson's disease and its animal models. 
PET study using FDOPA revealed presynaptic dopaminergic function in the striatum of nigrostriatal system of the human brain and many studies have performed to clarify the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

Clinically parkinsonian symptom is dominant and then it is difficult to distinguish from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Drug-induced parkinsonism(DIP) is at present the second most frequent cause of parkinsonism next to idiopathic Parkinson's disease(PD) in Japan. 
The patients with JP responded better to L-dopa and more gradual progression of symptoms, but, developed dopa-induced dyskinesias and motor fluctuations earlier and more frequently than Parkinson's disease patients. 
As a result of the increased life expectancy with L-dopa treatment the mean duration of the disease has increased in Parkinson's disease and JP, however, mean age at death in JP was still under 60. 
This finding is different from those in dystonia syndromes such as dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation(HPD), and it is rather similar to late onset of Parkinson's disease. 
Recently, hereditary progressive dystonia(HPD), a dopamine-dependent disorder, was identified as a nosological entity from JP and Parkinson's disease(PD) by discovery of mutations of the gene. 
JP includes young onset Parkinson's disease(YOPD) and idiopathic JP with much younger-onset cases. 
 All major symptoms of Parkinson's disease, i.e., rigidity, tremor, hypokinesia and postural instability are induced by an impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigro-striatal pathway. 
Levodopa pioneered the symptomatic therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Anticholinergics and amantadine are often effective as adjuvant drugs for the early stage of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, L-threo-DOPS, nor-adrenergic precursor drug, is sometimes effective for the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus coadministration of multiple antiparkinsonian drugs, rather than single therapy of levodopa, is useful for the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Treatment of Parkinson's disease has progressed steadily for the last decades after introduction of levodopa. 
 Although levodopa is the most effective therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease (PD) and has improved the QOL and increased the life expectancy of patients with PD, its beneficial effects are not permanent.

Nevertheless, mesencephalic cultures with increased hSOD1 activity appear to survive better than normal control cultures in the oxidatively stressful environment of cell culture incubators, and such mesencephalic cells may be useful for cell grafting studies in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 L-Deprenyl is a relatively selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B that delays the emergence of disability and the progression of signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
As excitotoxic injury has been implicated in neurodegeneration, it is possible that deprenyl exerts its beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease by suppressing excitotoxic damage. 
Therefore, rhGDNF may have therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease. 
Among the effects are: a decrease in the secretion of dopamine at the level of the putamen, which produces the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and chorea due to chronic transitory faulty blood supply and oxygen to the caudate nucleus, ballism by hypoxia at the level of subthalamic nuclei and athetosis in the lenticular nucleus. 
 Transplantation of neural tissue into the mammalian central nervous system has become an alternative treatment for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
Logistical and ethical problems in the clinical use of human fetal neural grafts as a source of dopamine for Parkinson's disease patients has hastened a search for successful ways to use animal dopaminergic cells for human transplantation. 
These novel features support Sertoli cells as a viable graft source for facilitating the use of xenotransplantation for Parkinson's disease and suggest their use as facilitators, (i.e., localized immunosuppression) for cell transplantation in general.

PET allows us to assess the progression of the nigral lesions in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The neurotoxin MPTP has been used to create an animal model of Parkinson's disease in the mouse, in part, because it causes a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (nucleus A9). 
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether MPTP also causes degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in nuclei A8 and A10 in the mouse, as occurs in humans with Parkinson's disease. 
These data (1) provide further evidence for differential susceptibility to MPTP toxicity among different mouse strains, (2) indicate that a significant depletion of striatal dopamine is not necessarily due to degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, (3) provide the precise locations of midbrain dopaminergic cells that are vulnerable to MPTP, which will aid future studies that seek to determine the mechanism/s by which-MPTP selectively destroys only certain midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and (4) indicate that MPTP produces midbrain dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the same nuclei in the C57BL16 mouse that degenerate in humans with Parkinson's disease. 
 The contribution of dopaminergic systems to cognitive defects in Parkinson's disease and the cognitive effects of levodopa remain controversial. 
These results confirm previous findings of selective adverse effects of levodopa on highly demanding executive tasks in Parkinson's disease and additionally suggest that some previous discrepancies between studies may be accounted for by lack of differentiation between stable and wearing-off conditions. 
 We have investigated regional changes in dopamine metabolism within the basal ganglia with clinical progression of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, using coregistration of [18F]dopa-PET and MRI images and comparing six normal subjects with 15 Parkinson's disease patients in a cross-sectional study.

The ability to turn in bed while lying supine before and after dopaminergic stimulation was studied in a group of 36 patients with Parkinson's disease; 23 were in Hoehn and Yahr stages 3-5 when "off", and 13 were in stages 1-2. 
Disorder of axial movement, gait, and postural stability were not dependent on age at onset of Parkinson's disease, but did relate to duration of disease. 
It is concluded that in the later stages of Parkinson's disease at least some aspects of axial motor control can remain dopamine responsive.

 BACKGROUND: No clinical parameter other than "sufficient" dopamine denervation and exposure to exogenous levodopa has been unquestionably linked to dyskinesia in levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease patients. 
 Although theoretical reasons exist for believing that selegiline slows the progression of Parkinson's disease, this has not been shown in clinical trials. 
Selegiline improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, allowing the introduction of levodopa to be delayed in de-novo patients and, later, for levodopa to be used at a lower dose. 
The main objective in the drug treatment of Parkinson's disease remains the optimization of the dose and frequency of levodopa administration. 
 The cause of dopamine cell death, thought to be the primary neurocytologic defect in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, remains unknown. 
The result of clinical trials utilizing neurotrophic factors, both as mesencephalic implant support strategies and as definitive treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, are awaited with cautious optimism. 
 Oxidant stress resulting from excess dopamine (DA) may contribute to the development and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 An imbalance between glutamate and dopamine in the striatum may contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
 Brains from 21 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), nine with diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), six with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and five with Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as 20 normal subjects were examined to detect apolipoprotein E (ApoE) by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. 
The classical mixed type dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonist apomorphine, although used clinically in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, has never been examined for any properties related to neuroprotection. 
Since oxidative stress has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, the role of apomorphine as a neuroprotective is worthy of examination.

 The concentration of (R)-N-methylsalsolinol, which is a dopamine-derived neurotoxin selective to dopamine neurons and induces parkinsonism in rats, was found to be increased significantly in the cerebrospinal fluid of untreated patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The individual differences in the activities of the enzymes determining the metabolism of (R)-N-methylsalsolinol in the brain might be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Poor survival of embryonic dopamine neurons is a primary problem limiting the value of neurotransplantation for Parkinson's disease. 
 Neurotransplantation of human fetal dopamine (DA) neurons is currently being investigated as a therapeutic modality for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 A patient with Parkinson's disease received bilateral fetal human nigral implants from six donors aged 6.5 to 9 weeks post-conception. 
 6-Hydroxydopamine-induced nerve terminal lesion of the nigrostriatal system may provide a partial lesion model of Parkinson's disease useful for the assessment of neuroprotective treatments and behavioral recovery after therapeutic intervention. 
The behavioral, cellular, and neurochemical effects of the nerve terminal lesion thus bear some resemblance to the early stages of Parkinson's disease, where the severity of motor impairment is correlated with the loss of dopamine in the striatum and dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. 
The possible implications of the peroxidative action of LOX in Parkinson's disease and in aging are discussed. 
Finally, in clinically-oriented research, the lesion has been used to model aspects of Parkinson's disease, a human neurodegenerative disease which is neuronally characterized by a severe loss of the meso-striatal dopamine neurons. 
These and related results provide support for the hypothesis that the massive, irreversible loss of glutathione (GSH), increased 5-S-CyS-DA/DA concentration ratio, and depigmentation of dopaminergic neurons in the SN that all occur in Parkinson's disease (PD) might be caused by the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-mediated translocation of CySH (and/or GSH) into these cells. 
With progression of Parkinson's disease, the threshold for interdose dyskinesia lowers, while the threshold for antiparkinsonian efficacy is unchanged; therefore, the strategy is to maintain levodopa concentrations between these 2 thresholds and avoid high concentrations. 
 The loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (PD) may provoke a reorganization of cellular interactions in the nigrostriatal pathway. 
 A number of cholinoceptor antagonists used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease were examined for their ability to antagonize either the muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine D1 receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase or the muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation of [3H]-inositol phosphates ([3H]-IPs) formation in rat striatal membranes. 
 The current symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease mainly relies on agents which are able to restore dopaminergic transmission in the nigrostriatal pathway, such as the dopamine precursor levodopa or direct agonists of dopamine receptors. 
 The direct application of recombinant human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (rhGDNF) to the deep structures of the nigrostriatum has been shown previously to augment dopamine function and inhibit loss of substantia nigra neurons in rodent models of Parkinson's disease. 
This route of administration may be useful for stimulating dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
The results suggest that endogenous adenosine acting on A2a receptors can exert an inhibitory influence on the functional expression of D1-mediated responses in dopamine-denervated rats, and propose new possible therapeutic approaches in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Forty-six patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations and not optimally controlled on levodopa received as adjunct therapy a new nonergoline dopamine agonist, ropinirole, in a 3-month randomized placebo-controlled trial. 
 The levels of the neuropeptides Met- and Leu-enkephalin (MET-ENK, LEU-ENK), substance P and neurotensin were measured by a combined high performance liquid chromatography/radioimmunoassay (HPLC/RIA) method in postmortem samples of basal ganglia from Parkinson's disease patients, incidental Lewy body disease patients (pre-symptomatic Parkinson's disease) and matched controls. 
Dopamine (DA) levels were reduced in the caudate nucleus and putamen in Parkinson's disease, but unaltered in incidental Lewy body disease. 
The levels of MET-ENK were reduced in the caudate nucleus, putamen and substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. 
Leu-enkephalin levels were decreased in the putamen and were undetectable in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. 
Substance P levels were reduced in the putamen in Parkinson's disease. 
Neurotensin levels were increased in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease. 
Neurotensin levels in incidental Lewy body disease were not altered significantly, but tended to parallel the changes in Parkinson's disease. 
The changes in basal ganglia peptide levels in incidental Lewy body disease generally followed a trend similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease, but were less marked. 
We conclude that the toxic effect of MPTP at the striatal dopamine system in the MPTP primate model of Parkinson's disease is not correlated with the affinity profile of MPP+ for catecholamine transporters, but rather with the higher turnover number of MPP+ at the dopamine transporter. 
 Amantadine has been used for more than 20 years in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
However, levels of DOPA decarboxylase and the vesicular monoamine transporter, known to be reduced in Parkinson's disease, were normal. 
This decrease resembles the dopaminergic nigro-striatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The overactivity of subthalamopallidal and corticostriatal glutamatergic neurons observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) suggests that antagonists of glutamate receptor could be used to alleviate the motor symptoms of the disease. 
These results suggest that antagonists of AMPA and kainate receptors could be effective in alleviating motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease by blocking the overstimulation of pallidal and striatal neurons by glutamate. 
 Limitations of long term levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease represent a major problem in the management of many patients. 
Because typical adverse effects of dopamine receptor agonists may differ from those of levodopa, combination therapy is often effective and well tolerated.A variety of dopamine receptor agonists, both ergot and non-ergot derivatives, are useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease had decreased GCH activity in parallel with the decreases in TH activity and dopamine in the striatum, probably as the results of cell death. 
 Within the past 3 decades revolutionary changes have taken place in the pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease. 
Used alone, or often in combination, antiparkinsonian agents can dramatically and meaningfully ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Awareness of the potential for drug interactions with antiparkinsonian agents, and prompt recognition of them when they do occur, is vital for the optimum clinical management of Parkinson's disease. 
 Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, alleviates symptoms of Parkinson's disease, even when administered alone, and is used for its treatment. 
To evaluate whether this dual action might benefit patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who have developed levodopa-induced dyskinesias, the motor effects of FCE 23,884 were examined in seven such individuals using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. 
 Levodopa remains the cornerstone for managing Parkinson's disease. 
A better understanding of the cause of the disease and treatment-related complications could make managing Parkinson's disease more rewarding. 
The patient was discussed in neurological CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had young-onset Parkinson's disease with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra. 
Opinions were divided between Parkinson's disease and Lewy body negative young onset parkinsonism. 
Our patient ma  Changes in striatal binding of [11C]raclopride, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, induced by acute levodopa administration, were evaluated with PET in 10 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Evidence supports the role of hyperoxidation phenomena in the mechanism of nerve cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These findings indicate that CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent CYP3A4, may have a role in protecting against Parkinson's disease induced by MPTP and other potential environmental neurotoxins. 
The possible involvement of striatal dopamine in covert orienting is disputed, with conflicting reports of deficits in covert orienting in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The possible relevance of these findings to the treatment of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
The present data support the view that pergolide is capable of enhancing motor cortex inhibition which is known to be deficient in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
To study whether budipine has dopaminergic activity in vivo, we used the 6-hydroxydopamine rotational model of Parkinson's disease. 
5-HT2c receptor antagonists may have potential as treatment for Parkinson's disease in combination with dopamine receptor agonists. 
Depending on the site of production these compounds may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease or schizophrenia. 
These findings may be related to the gender differences which exist in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. 
 Recently, there has been a surge in the research regarding the pharmacologic and surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
This article reviews the latest modes of medical and surgical therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
The surgical treatment modalities have been stereotaxic implantations of dopamine-producing tissues (such as adrenal medulla and fetal mesencephalon) into the caudate nucleus and ventral pallidotomy of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The implantation of cells genetically modified to express trophic factors and tyrosine hydroxylase for the synthesis of L-dopa from tyrosine has been proposed as a possible route for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease, there is evidence of impaired mitochondrial function which reduces the capacity to synthesize ATP in dopamine neurons. 
Since it has been reported that manidipine can worsen parkinsonian symptoms in a patient with Parkinson's disease, we have evaluated catalepsy in manidipine-treated mice and compared this with flunarizine-and haloperidol-induced catalepsy. 
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of cabergoline in 188 levodopa/carbidopa-treated patients with suboptimally controlled Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We investigated the relationship between the rate of motor response after a standard levodopa oral dose and drug dynamic variables and disease-related factors in 66 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The present study employed differential-pulse voltammetry to assess the influence of foetal ventral mesencephalic grafts on dopamine overflow in the contralateral caudate putamen of the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Fifteen Thai patients with Parkinson's disease (7 females, 8 males) were enrolled in an open label trial of pergolide (a new dopamine agonist) to evaluate its safety and efficacy. 
Our study demonstrated the good toleration and efficacy of pergolide treatment for Thai patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Iatrogenically induced problems are well known in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Wrong dosage of these drugs in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease can lead to severe dyskinesia. 
All other drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease also have a side effect profile which must be known to the treating physician. 
 The present behavioral study was undertaken to investigate whether neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase mediates the abnormal consequences of increased NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in models of postural tremor, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. 
We conclude from these results that neuronal NO synthase does not serve as a major mediator of increased NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in animal models of Parkinson's disease, postural tremor and epilepsy. 
 We sought to determine whether the motor dysfunctions and neuroleptic sensitivity that can occur in patients with AIDS relates to a deficit of striatal dopamine innervation similar to that of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease results from the progressive degeneration of dopamine neurons that innervate the striatum. 
Here we extend the rodent studies to an animal closer to the human in brain organization and function, by evaluating the effects of GDNF injected intracerebrally in rhesus monkeys that have had the symptomatology and pathophysiological features of Parkinson's disease induced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 
The results indicate that GDNF may be of benefit in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, the low toxicity of isoquinoline derivatives towards PC12 cells suggests that high concentrations of or prolonged exposure to these compounds may be necessary to cause the neurodegenerative changes related to Parkinson's disease. 
We suggest that the selective degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease may be caused by an imbalance between the oxidation of dopamine and the availability of antioxidant defenses. 
These findings suggest that fetal nigral grafting may be a useful therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In view of the role of the reticular thalamic nucleus in tremor and attentional processes, which are altered in Parkinson's disease, this effect may contribute to the clinical manifestations of nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. 
This could offer an explanation for the better clinical profile of amantadine in Parkinson's disease, as therapeutically relevant concentrations of amantadine are likely to be more active in the striatum whereas memantine is likely to be more active in other structures. 
 Prior studies have documented functional and pathological compromise of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system in patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting the possibility of reduced catecholamine release into the circulation. 
We measured free plasma catechols in early and untreated patients with Parkinson's disease, but found no evidence of reduced concentrations, compared to control subjects or a group of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. 
Rather, there was a significant elevation of plasma norepinephrine within the Parkinson's disease group. 
Furthermore, 6 of 15 untreated Parkinson's disease patients (40%) displayed markedly elevated plasma concentrations of the catecholamine MAO metabolites, DOPAC or DOPEG. 
Despite this finding, platelet MAO-B activity measured in these and all other Parkinson's disease patients fell well within the range of the control subjects, and was also statistically similar to the group with Alzheimer's type dementia. 
These trends toward increased, rather than decreased, circulating catechol concentrations suggest that peripheral sympathetic nervous system catecholamine production and release is not severely compromised in patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
 A-77636 is a dopamine (DA) D1 receptor-selective agonist that was previously shown to elicit beneficial responses in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Kebabian et al.: Eur. 
We present results of compartmental analysis in subjects in whom we independently measured the kinetics of OMFD in the blood and striatum, and used this knowledge to solve for the kinetics of F-Dopa.METHODS: The kinetics of F-Dopa in striatum were measured with PET from 0 to 150 min after an intravenous bolus injection of tracer in four normal subjects and two patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
 We report the effect of papaverine, tetrahydro-papaverine, laudanosine, dimethoxyphenylethylamine, dopamine, and its metabolites on mitochondrial respiration and activities of the enzymes in the electron transfer complexes, as mitochondrial toxins may be implicated in the etiology and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Our results warrant further studies on these and some related compounds as candidate neurotoxins causing Parkinson's disease. 
 The aetiology of weight loss in patients with Parkinson's disease is likely to be multifactorial. 
We studied 15 patients with Parkinson's disease and 15 age- and sex-matched controls and looked for evidence of malabsorption due to small bowel bacterial overgrowth or alteration of intestinal permeability. 
There was a marked increase in orocaecal transit time in the patients with Parkinson's disease, although lactulose hydrogen breath testing did not show evidence of small bowel bacterial contamination. 
There was reduced absorption of mannitol in patients with Parkinson's disease while lactulose absorption was similar in both groups, suggesting decreased non-mediated uptake across the enterocyte brush border membrane in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Freezing, a symptom characterized by difficulty in the initiation and smooth pursuit of repetitive movements, is a unique and well known clinical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons to the adult striatum potentially offers a means to reverse the striatal dopamine deficiency that characterizes Parkinson's disease. 
This augmentation of DA levels suggests that local neurotrophic factor delivery by genetically engineered cells may provide a therapeutic strategy for preventing neuronal death or enhancing neuronal function in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 The D2 dopamine agonist piribedil is not widely used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease because it was thought to be effective mainly on parkinsonian tremor and to produce a high incidence of peripheral side effects, particular nausea. 
These data indicate that piribedil should be an effective monotherapy for Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease tremor occurs at rest, involves the jaw and limbs and is associated with bradykinesia, rigidity and falling. 
Parkinson's disease is treated with a number of medications, but levodopa, a dopamine precursor, is considered most effective. 
Other therapies in the early stages of Parkinson's disease may include neuroprotective agents, dopamine agonists, dopamine reuptake inhibitors, anticholinergics and/or amantadine. 
In this study, the results of iodine-123 IBZM SPECT and those of apomorphine tests were compared in 32 patients with extrapyramidal movement disorders--22 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and 10 with Parkinson's plus syndrome (PPS). 
 The oxidant stress theory of Parkinson's disease (PD) hypothesizes that levodopa treatment may be potentially harmful and this is supported by studies demonstrating levodopa toxicity to cultured dopaminergic neurons. 
 We investigated the dopamine receptor (DAR) mRNA expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 45 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 21 age-matched controls using the quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction method. 
Yet little is known about the neuropharmacological actions of cigarette smoke that contribute to smoking behaviour, or why smoking is so prevalent in psychiatric disorders and is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease. 
Among salsolinol analogs examined, only N-methyl-(R)- salsolinol (NM(R)Sal) induced behavioral changes very similar to those in Parkinson's disease: hypokinesia, stiff tail, limb twitching at rest and postural abnormality. 
These results demonstrate the selective cytotoxicity of NM(R)Sal to the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, and the possible involvement of this 6,7-dihydroxy-isoquinoline in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 Rat models of Parkinson's disease typically employ a rapid nigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to produce a near-complete loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and thus, model end stage disease. 
The D3 receptor may, therefore, be important in both the therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, but its pathogenic mechanism is still unknown. 
The data suggest that dopamine D2 receptor agonists and possibly dopamine D1 receptor antagonists will be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, probably by keeping extracellular levels of dopamine at more 'physiological' levels. 
In Parkinson's disease (PD), GCH, TH, and dopamine in the striatum may decrease in parallel, as the secondary effects caused by cell death. 
 The cellular expression of DAT mRNA and VMAT2 mRNA was investigated in sections of the human post-mortem substantia nigra in control and Parkinson's disease tissue using in situ hybridisation techniques. 
By contrast, the level of expression of both DAT mRNA and VMAT2 mRNA was markedly reduced in Parkinson's disease; these reductions in hybridisation signal were associated with (i) a marked loss of dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra, and (ii) a reduction in both DAT and VMAT2 signal per cell in the remaining pigmented neurones. 
It has potential pharmacokinetic advantages that are superior to those of levodopa itself, and its subcutaneous administration may become an effective rescue strategy to overcome "off" situations in patients with Parkinson's disease and response fluctuations. 
These results suggest that ventrolateral striatal dopamine depletions in rats produce deficits in skilled motor control that are similar to the motor deficits observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Our results suggest that L-DOPA and dopamine might have a complex mixture of pro- and anti- oxidant effects, which could contribute to tissue damage due to oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. 
 It has been suggested that nitric oxide could be implicated in the neuronal degeneration of substantia nigra compacta in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Recently, it has been reported decreased CSF nitrate levels (oxidation product that provides an indirect estimation of nitric oxide) in Parkinson's disease patients, assessed with a colorimetric method. 
We studied the CSF and plasma levels of nitrate with a kinetic cadmium-reduction method in 31 Parkinson's disease patients and 38 matched controls. 
CSF and plasma nitrate levels did not correlate with age at onset, duration, scores of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scales and Hoehn & Yahr staging in the patients group. 
These A2 receptor-mediated adenosine actions might have potential therapeutic interest, in particular in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea, as well as in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndromes. 
 Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuronal metabolic dysfunction appear to be central to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Lastly, we examined the effects of chronic administration ofD1-like and D2-like dopamine receptor agonists on striatal deltaFosB expression in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of Parkinson's disease. 
The present findings that MDF and aFGF may have neurochemical effects in vivo on the lesioned nigrostriatal dopaminergic system suggest their potential pharmacological role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Prolongation of the VEP latencies has been demonstrated in patients with MS and in other neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder characterized by deficient cerebral dopamine (DA) functions. 
Measurement of nerve growth factor (NGF) showed that NGF level at the distal stump of the pretransected peripheral nerve increased significantly, thus, we have applied cografting of chromaffin cells with this stump of the peripheral nerve to animal models of Parkinson's disease since chromaffin cell survival have been reported to be increased by supplementation of nerve growth factor (NGF) in vitro and in vivo. 
Polymer-encapsulated dopamine-secreting cells are another donor candidates and can be applied combined with stereotaxic thalamotomy or pallidotomy for the patients with Parkinson's disease in the near future. 
 We studied the effect of non-nociceptive ipsilateral digital stimulation on EMG recorded from a small hand muscle before and after the administration of subcutaneous apomorphine in 6 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease who have marked motor fluctuations, the inhibitory response of upper limb motor neurones to low level digital cutaneous stimulation can be altered by dopamine agonists. 
 In the present study, side preferences in spontaneous visual exploration were assessed systematically in 27 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and 17 age-matched controls. 
The atypical IVE in patients with predominantly left-sided Parkinson's disease should be interpreted in the context of recent concepts of attention postulating that a bias in early spontaneous orientation directed to the ipsilesional hemifield reflects a mild and residual manifestation of hemineglect. 
The present findings contribute a new aspect to the complex picture of cognitive and visuospatial abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. 
 Five patients with Parkinson's disease, unilaterally transplanted with foetal mesencephalic cells into putamen (n=1) or putamen and caudate (n=4), were followed throughout a period of 15-36 months after surgery, according to the recommendations of the core assessment programme for intracerebral transplantations (CAPIT). 
 L-DOPA kills dopamine neurones in culture but is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, where it exhibits no clear toxicity. 
Together, these data suggest that 4 and its derivatives may be powerful tools in the study of dopamine receptor function and also have potential clinical utility in Parkinson's disease and other conditions where perturbation of dopamine receptors is useful. 
DAT also can transport dopamine neurotoxins and has been implicated in the selective vulnerability of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in major models of Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore, in considering environmental agents resembling MPTP as potential causes of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, the size of aromatic groups attached to the alicyclic ring appears not to be critical in terms of the dopamine transporter. 
 We could quantify the tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative salsolinol in urine of patients with Parkinson's disease and normal control subjects by means of high performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. 
Thus, salsolinol appears as a predictor for hallucinosis in Parkinson's disease. 
 The continuing lack of effective long-term therapies for Parkinson's disease and other disorders in which a primary symptom is involuntary tremor is leading to a search for alternative pharmacological strategies. 
Antagonists of adenosine, such as theophylline, have been reported to improve the tremor in cases of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, and the development of better and more selective A2a receptor antagonists may prove of value in these disabling disorders. 
Neurological measures revealed large behavioral deficits in the affected forelimb analogous to the deficits exhibited in Parkinson's disease patients, and these deficits were significantly attenuated with some doses of oral Sinemet (30-40 mg/kg). 
The results of the present study suggest that it is possible to investigate the therapeutic potential of novel treatments as well as their effects on the therapeutic window of oral Sinemet in this rodent model of Parkinson's disease. 
 INTRODUCTION: Etiology of depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with serotonergic dysfunction. 
The relevance of these findings to the use of L-dopa in treating Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 Exogenous application of levodopa is conventionally used to equalize the striatal dopamine deficit in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 N-Methyl(R)salsolinol, an endogenous neurotoxin, has been proposed to be closely involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
The results are discussed in relation to pathogenesis Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) became the first neurological disease to be treated palliatively by neurotransmitter replacement therapy. 
 Coimplants of adrenal medulla (AM) and peripheral nerve (PN) in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown that AM cells survive longer, tend to show neuronal phenotype, and enhance sprouting of host fibers. 
 With estimates as high as 1 million patients in the United States, Parkinson's disease is a relatively common neurological disorder. 
It has long been thought that the primary biochemical disturbance in Parkinson's disease is dopamine related. 
In addition, there are several disease and drug-induced physiological aberrancies that can have profound anesthetic implications in the patient with Parkinson's disease (e.g., aspiration pneumonitis, myocardial irritability, hypotension, hypertension, and respiratory impairment). 
Although surgical therapy for Parkinson's disease has a long history, with the advent of advanced neuroimaging techniques there has been a resurgence of these procedures (e.g., pallidotomy and thalamotomy) for advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. 
It is likely that these surgical procedures will become more commonplace, possibly prolonging the lifespan of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
It's incumbent on anesthesiologists to become familiar with the special needs of patients with Parkinson's disease and alter the "days in hell" attitude among these patients toward surgery and anesthesia. 
Various anatomic and physiological models are discussed which emphasize specialized neuronal circuits (somewhat similar to those involved in Parkinson's disease) and certain specific neurotransmitters such as dopamine, together with the reactivity of these circuits to intracranial pressure variations. 
 The low availability of dopamine containing neurons for grafting in Parkinson's disease is a general problem. 
 The use of a dopamine agonist with a long duration of action has theoretical advantages in attempting to reduce the motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
 A negative correlation has been found between smoking and Parkinson's disease. 
 Exposure to elevated levels of Manganese (Mn) can result in an irreversible brain disease characterized by extrapyramidal signs and symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease. 
Taken together, these data suggest that this glycoprotein, if allowed to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS), may promote some neurodegenerative changes that can occur in disorders like Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that eliprodil displays a far lower propensity than many other NMDA receptor antagonists for disturbing posture and gait, but lacks the essential motor stimulant action required to make it a safe and effective antiparkinsonian agent, at least in the reserpine-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease, known also as striatal dopamine deficiency syndrome, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by akinesia, muscular rigidity, tremor at rest, and postural abnormalities. 
The loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease results in enhanced metabolism of dopamine, augmenting the formation of H2O2, thus leading to generation of highly neurotoxic hydroxyl radicals (OH.). 
Studies of the substantia nigra after death in Parkinson's disease have suggested the presence of oxidative stress and depletion of reduced glutathione; a high level of total iron with reduced level of ferritin; and deficiency of mitochondrial complex I. 
New approaches designed to attenuate the effects of oxidative stress and to provide neuroprotection of striatal dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease include blocking dopamine transporter by mazindol, blocking NMDA receptors by dizocilpine maleate, enhancing the survival of neurons by giving brain-derived neurotrophic factors, providing antioxidants such as vitamin E, or inhibiting monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) by selegiline. 
Among all of these experimental therapeutic refinements, the use of selegiline has been most successful in that it has been shown that selegiline may have a neurotrophic factor-like action rescuing striatal neurons and prolonging the survival of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Catecholamine autoxidation produces reactive oxygen species that have been implicated in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal region of the brain that occurs during normal aging and in Parkinson's disease. 
 Fluctuations in motor performance and dyskinesias are a common problem in the long-term management of Parkinson's disease. 
 An 8-year nationwide study of bromocriptine monotherapy and combination therapy with bromocriptine and levodopa in Parkinson's disease is reported. 
 Among the motor tetrad of Parkinson's disease, akinesia is not easy to define and controversies still exist on the nature of akinesia. 
The author suggested that the main pathological structure of the condition was different from the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and that the condition was different from Parkinson's disease. 
Alterations in striatal synaptic plasticity might be implicated in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. 
 Decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) levels are an early marker of nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
At last in this model of Parkinson's disease, thioctic acid does not appear to have a neuroprotective effect. 
CONCLUSION: The results of this study offer promising perspectives for the application of tolcapone as adjunct therapy to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Twenty-eight (16%) developed Parkinson's disease. 
Although NMDA receptor antagonists of the phencyclidine (PCP) type are precluded from clinical use because of their psychotomimetic properties, amantadine and memantine have been administered to human patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and spasticity for many years without serious adverse effects. 
 Neural transplantation of genetically modified cells has been successfully employed to reverse functional deficits in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. 
This regulatable cell line and general approach may provide additional insight on the potential utilization of cell transplants for treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. 
Similarly, we await the results of a large multicenter, controlled trial comparing standard Sinemet and Sinemet CR in de novo patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Since the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system modulates striatal cholinergic function, and dopamine D2 receptor blockade is known to result in increased striatal cholinergic function, the refractoriness of striatal cholinergic neurons following the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation confirms the existence of a dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance in Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore the combination of a D2 antagonist and radiolabelled VR ligand may provide a potentially useful method for assessing the effects of dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease. 
 Transplantation of fetal dopaminergic neurons to the striatum can ameliorate neurological deficits exhibited by experimental animals and human graft recipients with Parkinson's disease. 
These findings demonstrate that BDNF exerts a significant effect on the functional reinnervation of the striatum by transplanted fetal dopamine neurons in the rat, and suggest that application of this factor might similarly improve the clinical efficacy of neural transplantation employed in the treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 We have used in vivo single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the dopamine transporter with 2 beta-carboxymethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([123I] beta-CIT) to investigate striatal dopamine transporter loss in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This approach is expected to be applied in Parkinson's disease in the near future. 
A-86929 and ABT-431 improved behavioral disability scores and increased locomotor activity in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned marmoset model of Parkinson's disease in a dose-dependent manner (the minimum effective dose was 0.10 mumol/kg s.c.). 
Current Parkinson's disease therapy includes L-dopa, which stimulates both classes of DA receptors by virtue of its conversion to DA in vivo, and direct-acting D2-selective agonists. 
An agent such as A-86929 (or its prodrug ABT-431), which selectively stimulates the D1 receptor, may represent a novel mechanism for Parkinson's disease therapy with the potential for an improved side-effect profile and, consequently, improved patient compliance. 
The purpose of this investigation was to compare the striatal binding and kinetics of this radioligand in patients with Parkinson's disease and normal controls.METHODS: Six patients with Parkinson's disease and three normal controls were examined. 
CONCLUSION: Iodine-123-iodo-lisuride SPECT seems useful for imaging intact striatal dopamine D2 receptors in patients with Parkinson's disease and may provide clinically relevant information for quantitative assessment of the availability and integrity of dopamine D2 receptors. 
These findings suggest that GDNF could be useful in the development of therapeutic approaches to Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by dopaminergic cell loss. 
Rats were treated for 2 weeks with drugs known to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission, including those commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We have investigated whether glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protects against a complete unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) nigrostriatal lesion, a robust rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
They are encouraging for potential use of GDNF in Parkinson's disease. 
Decline in this neurotransmitter receptor is also observed in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease and late-stage Parkinson's disease. 
 Drug-induced dyskinesias are a major drawback of the dopaminergic therapies currently employed to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 The efficacy of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in ameliorating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) is attributed to its conversion to dopamine (DA) by the enzyme aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the striatum. 
It is possible that similar cells could contribute to the efficacy of L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease was combined with intracerebral drug infusions to examine the influence of glutamate receptors on striatal output activity. 
These results suggest a role for striatal AMPA-kainate receptors in the pathology and treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The mechanisms that lead to degeneration of melanized dopaminergic neurons in the brain stem, and particularly in the substantia nigra (SN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are still unknown. 
 The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
These properties of dbcAMP could be of therapeutic value in Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between striatal dopa decarboxylase capacity, D2 dopamine receptor binding, and energy metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contains substance(s) that inhibit the growth and functions of dopaminergic neurons. 
 L-DOPA can often induce psychotic reactions during treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
This study was undertaken to assess, in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, the impact of L-DOPA treatment on two potential biological risk factors for psychosis, namely, an increase in prefrontal cortex dopamine and an increase in the stress-related hormone corticosterone. 
These findings suggest that L-DOPA-sensitive mechanisms are supersensitized in Parkinson's disease model rats. 
 The main neuropathological feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in a loss of dopamine in the striatum. 
 We review the recent progress in the research of the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
It has been postulated that mitochondrial respiratory failure and oxidative stress are two major contributors to nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
The primary cause of Parkinson's disease is still unknown, but we believe the interaction of environmental toxins and genetic predispositions is important. 
In this respect, molecular genetic studies on familial Parkinson's disease are very important. 
 Dyskinesias occur in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease chronically treated with L-DOPA and also occur in several nonhuman primate species after 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and L-DOPA treatment. 
The MPTP-treated marmoset provides a useful model in which to study dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease and to examine new therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating this common side effect of chronic dopamine replacement therapy. 
DAT binding, both in vivo (positron emission tomography) and in vitro (post mortem) may serve as a presynaptic marker to measure altered DA innervation in several neuropsychiatric diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Tourette's disease, schizophrenia or cocaine addiction. 
In Parkinson's disease, a reduction in the density of binding sites could be due either to a degeneration of the terminal dopaminergic projections or to a compensatory readjustment in the level of dopamine synaptic transmission. 
 BACKGROUND: To improve dose-related fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease, the efficacy of pergolide, a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist, was determined. 
METHODS: Using a stringent diagnostic criterion for Parkinson's disease, 20 patients were selected for a short-term open-label trial, and were divided into three groups based on the accuracy of clinical diagnosis. 
CONCLUSIONS: Pergolide is very effective for moderate to advanced Parkinson's disease. 
 The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is largely unknown. 
Expanding in vitro the number of dopamine precursors provides tissue that may be suitable for transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 A computational neural model of movement production in normal and Parkinson's disease (PD) is used to provide a neural account for the source of micrographia in PD handwriting. 
These results suggest that neurotoxins causing striatal dopamine loss may act through different mechanisms, which could be significant for the etiopathogenic development of Parkinson's disease. 
Paraquat might be useful for studying the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vitro, and MNA is expected to be one of the causal substances of PD from the viewpoint of the oxidative stress theory. 
Thus nigral neurokinin receptors can modulate normal dopamine cell activity and may provide a therapeutic target in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
This phenotype presents analogies with symptoms characteristic of Parkinson's disease. 
The ability of LIF to prevent proliferation of dopamine terminals may have important implications for our understanding of neural regeneration, the aetiology of Parkinson's disease and its treatment by intrastriatal grafting. 
Our study examined the efficacy and tolerability of HP-200, derived from Mucuna prurient, in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Sixty patients with Parkinson's disease (46 male and 14 female) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 59 +/- 9 years were treated in an open study for 12 weeks. 
HP-200, developed from an alternative medicine source, Ayurveda, was found to be an effective treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease. 
CDP-choline has also been shown to be effective as co-therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
 The amino-adamantane derivatives memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane) and amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) are relatively low affinity, uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists which have been used clinically in the treatment of dementia and Parkinson's disease respectively for several years without serious side effects. 
It should be stressed that these data do not contradict the known therapeutic safety of memantine and amantadine in dementia and Parkinson's disease respectively. 
 Studies on the concentration-effect relationship of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have established that: (1) in patients with a fluctuating response to levodopa, concentration-effect profiles are steeper and markedly shifted to the right (i.e. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease who do not have response fluctuations exhibit a residual capacity of production and storage of endogenous dopamine; thus, lower amounts of 'exogenous' dopamine (formed by decarboxylation of levodopa) are required. 
 Striatal dopamine D2 receptors were studied, using positron emission tomography (PET), in 10 patients with early Parkinson's disease without any antiparkinsonian medication and in 14 healthy controls. 
The present results show that there is both a relative and absolute increase in the number of dopamine D2 receptors in the putamen, but not in the caudate nucleus in early Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease (PD), which results predominantly from nigrostriatal pathway damage, is used as a window to examine basal ganglia function. 
 We evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa-responsive patients with Parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, before and after the administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice per day) for 11 +/- 1 days. 
 Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) have been found to reduce the severe akinetic motor symptom produced in animal models of Parkinson's disease, such as in monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or in monoamine-depleted rats. 
 Clinical studies suggest that gut disorders are common in Parkinson's disease, but the morphological basis is unknown. 
Depletion of dopamine-containing neurons in the central nervous system is a basic defect in Parkinson's disease. 
We compared colonic tissue from 11 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, 17 with adenocarcinoma (normal tissue was studied), and five who underwent colectomy for severe constipation. 
Nine of the 11 Parkinson's disease patients had substantially fewer dopaminergic myenteric neurons than the other subjects (mean 0.4 [SE 0.2] vs 6.9 [2.3] in controls and 5.7 [2.0] in constipated subjects). 
Two Parkinson's disease patients had similar distributions of all types of neurons, including dopaminergic myenteric neurons, to the controls. 
High-performance liquid chromatography showed lower levels of dopamine in the muscularis externa (but not mucosa) in four Parkinson's disease patients than in four controls (7.3 [5.1] vs 24.2 [4.6] nmol per g protein), but levels of dopamine metabolites were similar in the two groups. 
The identification of this defect of dopaminergic neurons in the enteric nervous system in Parkinson's disease may lead to better treatment of colorectal dysfunction in this disease. 
In this pilot study, the protective and palliative effects of riluzole have been examined using an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
These preliminary results suggest that riluzole could possess neuroprotective and palliative effects in a primate model of Parkinson's disease. 
 In rodent models of Parkinson's disease such as reserpinized or 6-hydroxydopamine substantia nigra lesioned rats, blockade of glutamate receptors of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) or the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) receptor subtypes and concomitant treatment with L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) or direct dopamine agonists restores locomotor activity and induces rotations. 
Due to its presumed antiglutamatergic action it has been suggested that lamotrigine may be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In a preliminary open-label study in patients with Parkinson's disease some favourable effects were reported. 
The present study was undertaken to systematically investigate the effects of lamotrigine in rat models of Parkinson's disease. 
On the basis of these negative results it is predicted that lamotrigine will not have significant favourable effects on akinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease patients. 
 We investigated clinical response and pharmacokinetics of levodopa when entacapone, a catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, was administered concomitantly with either a standard (Std) or a controlled-release (CR) levodopa/carbidopa preparation to 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In L-DOPA psychosis in Parkinson's disease, the clozapine concentration (in the plasma water or spinal fluid) for 75% blockade of dopamine D4 receptors may be predicted as approximately 3 nM, in general agreement with the value of approximately 1.2 nM in Parkinson patients who have L-DOPA psychosis. 
 We studied the relationship between levodopa response and antituberculous treatment in a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease whose parkinsonism deteriorated when treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid (Rifinah) for pulmonary tuberculosis was started. 
 Oxidant stress secondary to dopamine metabolism has been proposed as a pathogenic factor in the development of Parkinson's disease. 
Previous investigators have found abnormally elevated concentrations of the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, in the plasma and serum of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We detected no significant elevations in mean serum malondialdehyde concentrations in either levodopa-treated or untreated patients with Parkinson's disease, compared to normal controls; similarly, no elevation was found in a group of patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. 
In conclusion, analysis of several blood products relevant to oxidant stress, including malondialdehyde, 5-S-cysteinyl-dopa, alpha-tocopherol, and uric acid, failed to distinguish patients with Parkinson's disease or dementia of Alzheimer's type from controls. 
This article reviews the prevalence, diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of psychosis in Parkinson's disease. 
Psychosis in Parkinson's disease has been associated with all antiparkinsonian medications. 
 Two strategies of drug therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) are neuroprotective and symptomatic. 
 The clinical relevance of a long-duration response (LDR) to levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been widely recognized. 
 The administration of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) to patients with Parkinson's disease is known to produce acute effects that include the reduction of rigidity as well as delayed therapeutic actions involving the resumption of complex motor behavior. 
This may be the major factor underlying the delayed therapeutic benefits of L-DOPA therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These receptors are the primary targets in treatment of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. 
 This article describes the attempt to develop educational material for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) and for their partners. 
 Early stage Parkinson's disease may be better left untreated if it does not limit motor function. 
Increased accessibility of dopamine to the nigral cell nucleus or inability to scavenge excess free radicals generated from dopamine oxidation triggering programmed cell death, may cause the progressive nigral degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
Its action is necessary for the selectivities of dopaminergic neurotoxins that provide the best current experimental models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Pramipexole (PPX) is currently being evaluated for treatment of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
Current drug treatment of both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease focus on drugs which modify dopamine activity in the brain. 
 We evaluated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of pramipexole, a novel dopamine D2 receptor agonist, in early Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Drug holidays as treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) to ameliorate the effects of chronic L-dopa use are a controversial method. 
 Activation studies with positron emission tomography (PET) have provided an understanding of the pathophysiology of akinesia and tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine D2 receptor imaging was performed with 123I labeled 2'-iodospiperone (2'-ISP) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 9 patients: 4 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 2 with parkinsonism, 1 with Wilson's disease and 2 with pituitary tumor, and the results were compared with the data for 9 normal subjects. 
All the patients with Parkinson's disease also demonstrated symmetrical basal ganglia uptake in the late SPECT images, but it was diminished in parkinsonism and Wilson's disease. 
These results suggest a functional role for D1 receptors in stimulating motor behavior in a primate model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The goal was to visualize cerebral dopamine-D2 receptors in 6 patients with Parkinson's disease and in 3 healthy controls using iodine-123-Lisuride-SPECT. 
The mild paw reaching impairments observed in animals with moderate depletions of dopamine are proposed as a model of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease that may be useful for the development of protective or restorative therapies. 
 Animal models with partial lesions of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway may be useful for developing neuroprotective and neurotrophic therapies for Parkinson's disease. 
This study indicates that intrastriatal injection of different doses of 6-hydroxydopamine can be used to cause increasing amounts of dopamine denervation, which could model Parkinson's disease of varying degrees of severity. 
Injecting 3.5 microliters of 2.5 micrograms/microliters 6-hydroxydopamine appears to be particularly useful as a general model of early Parkinson's disease, since it induces a lesion characterized by robust drug-induced rotation, changes in binding consistent with approximately 70% dopamine denervation, approximately 19% dopamine D22 receptor up-regulation, negligible intrinsic striatal damage and stability for at least 12 weeks. 
This study outlines a technique for inducing partial lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway in rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  Oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Since the SH-SY5Y cells used in these grafts express the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and synthesize dopamine in vitro, these cells were used in the hope that they may potentially be useful for repairing lesions in the dopamine pathway, such as that seen in Parkinson's disease. 
 We could identify the MPTP-like compound and isoquinoline derivative N-methyl-norsalsolinol (2-MDTIQ) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In order to study the relationship between presence of 2-MDTIQ and dopamine metabolism, we examined 3-O-methyl-dopa (MDOPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in CSF of 15 normal control subjects and 34 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Selegiline (L-deprenyl), a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, ameliorates the "wearing off" akinesia and delays the need for levodopa in mild, previously untreated Parkinson's disease. 
The therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of MAO-A in Parkinson's disease has not been examined in detail. 
We have given moclobemide, a selective, reversible inhibitor of MAO-A, to nondepressed patients with Parkinson's disease receiving standard levodopa/peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor or levodopa with dopaminergic agonist (bromocriptine, pergolide). 
In acute levodopa challenge, the latency of motor response was significantly shortened and its duration was prolonged during moclobemide treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is a treatment intended to prevent or reduce neuronal degeneration. 
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate endogenous cerebrospinal fluid catecholamines in Parkinson's disease. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Basal concentrations of free norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), epinephrine (E), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and plasma were measured using reverse-phase HPLC with electrochemical detection in 16 patients with Parkinson's disease and 21 control patients with low back pain. 
CONCLUSIONS: These results point towards a diffuse neuronal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and indicate that lumbar csf NE and csf DOPAC are of central nervous origin. 
 The mechanism of nigral cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown, but it is increasingly proposed that free radical reactions are important in the disease pathology. 
The consequences of this inactivity are discussed in terms of the reliability of this model to test new drugs with putative efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The possible use of dextromethorphan as an adjunct to L-DOPA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in man, is discussed. 
 Six healthy controls and eighteen patients with Parkinson's disease in different disability stages were studied with SPECT using [(123)I]beta-CIT to label the striatal dopamine transporter. 
 Problems associated with the long-term use of L-dopa to treat Parkinson's disease have prompted considerable interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies for this disorder. 
These studies not only offer promise for treating Parkinson's disease, but also provide insights into properties of the nigrostriatal system that may eventually help to prevent neuronal degeneration. 
 Amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) is clinically used for the management of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. 
 The cocaine analog 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-[4-iodophenyl]tropane (beta-CIT) labeled with 11C was used to study dopamine reuptake sites with PET.METHODS: Three normal subjects and nine patients with Parkinson's disease were investigated. 
 We used equilibrium analysis of SPECT data from patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease to determine if lateralized differences in the striatal uptake of [123I]IBZM correlate with asymmetry in clinical findings and, by inference, with lateralized differences in the concentration of extracellular dopamine.METHODS: Twelve patients with asymmetric clinical signs of idiopathic Parkinson's disease were injected with a bolus of [123I]IBZM, and multiple SPECT scans recorded the time course of radioligand uptake. 
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the ability of [123I]IBZM SPECT to reveal clinically meaningful variations in striatal dopamine receptor availability in patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease. 
 The search for trophic factors that can support injured dopaminergic neurons and can enhance dopaminergic graft survival and outgrowth for therapeutic uses in Parkinson's disease has lately focused on members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta super-family. 
 Bromocriptine or pergolide can be used as initial monotherapy in Parkinson's disease. 
The possible involvement of this catechol isoquinoline in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a depletion of dopamine (DA) neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. 
To determine whether stimulus change detection is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD), we recorded ERPs in 13 non-demented patients with PD and in 11 age-matched healthy control subjects both when tones were attended and when they were unattended. 
Although there is some evidence of improved cognitive ability after transplantation, it is improbable that normal cognitive function can be restored by this procedure because the impairments of cognitive ability associated with Parkinson's disease do not appear to originate solely from dopamine deficiency. 
 Psychosis, linked to chronic levodopa and other antiparkinsonian drug treatments, is a common and incapacitating complication of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Thanks to these properties, L-deprenyl has gained wide acceptance in the therapy of Parkinson's disease by using L-deprenyl both with levodopa and alone. 
The most marked increase in afterdischarge threshold (up to 250% above control) was seen after a dose of 10 mg/kg, whereas the D-enantiomer was ineffective at this dosage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Application of the common marmoset to pharmacological studies was reviewed, especially employment of the animal as a model of Parkinson's disease were presented. 
We showed that the common marmoset was a useful animal for studies on Parkinson's disease, dopamine metabolism by microdialysis and nausea/vomiting. 
MAO type B inhibitors were applied for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The role of dopamine deficiency in dystonia and the role of levodopa in the development of fluctuations in Parkinson's disease are discussed. 
Evidence from animal models suggests that drugs that block glutamatergic neurotransmission might be beneficial in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the relevance of these animal models to the human pathology is not clear. 
However, preliminary clinical results suggest riluzole to be efficacious in prolonging survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and certain weak NMDA receptor antagonists are currently used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus far, these DRD4 alleles have been investigated for association with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, and chronic alcoholism, and all have been largely negative for a direct association. 
 We compared the concentrations of dopaminergic substances in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with clinical severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) under L-dopa/carbidopa treatment and under L-dopa/carbidopa+tolcapone treatment. 
In Parkinson's disease, there appears to be selective degeneration of the most heavily pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra, and this process has been linked to the presence of neuromelanin. 
 The development of drug-induced behavioral sensitization is thought to underlie many of the motor complications that accompany chronic L-DOPA treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide, are supposed to be involved in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 There are increased latencies of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and electroretinograms (PERGs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who have not received therapy. 
 The hypothesis that L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease may augment neuronal damage and thus accelerate the progression of the disease remains controversial. 
Furthermore, since apoptosis is an active cellular program which can be modulated, we suggest clinical approaches for decreasing L-DOPA toxicity, thus preventing acceleration of neuronal damage in Parkinson's disease. 
These results show that (R)-salsolinol and N-methyl-(R)-salsolinol may be neuroprotective and neurotoxic, respectively, and thus might be in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine agonists have been indicated as treatment for disorders such as Parkinson's disease, cardiogenic shock and dopamine insufficiency. 
Based on our observations, the MMQ cell line can be considered a useful tool for investigating ligand-receptor interactions to develop new selective dopaminergic D2L ligands for the therapy of dopamine-related disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson's disease and drug addiction. 
Parkinson's disease causes a 4- to 6-Hz resting tremor in the arms and legs that responds to the use of anticholinergics and a combination of carbidopa and levodopa. 
We conclude that the retinal deficit of dopamine in Parkinson's disease is reflected in diminished centre/surround inhibition and that these changes are primarily apparent when vision is tested along the tritan axis, because blue cones are sparsely distributed. 
 Direct infusion of dopamine into the corpus striatum has been proposed as a potential approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The present results support the concept that intrastriatal dopamine infusion may be a useful therapeutic approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent reports have stressed an accumulation of iron and enhanced levels of lipid peroxides in the substantia nigra as essential factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
On the other hand, L-DOPA, which is used extensively to treat Parkinson's disease, undergoes autoxidation (as does dopamine), thus generating reactive oxygen species. 
Added superoxide dismutase had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, of which the most prominent morphological feature is the progressive loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. 
Increased glutamatergic transmission in the basal ganglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The physical manifestations of PD require a large reduction in caudate and putamen DA levels and no such depletion was measured in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Levodopa-induced motor fluctuations (MF) is a disabling complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and is usually refractory to conventional treatment. 
In addition, some findings are open to question because of the experimental material chosen for the study, such as the measurement of NADH oxidase activity in platelets in Parkinson's disease, which affects selectively the dopamine neurons, or the use of autopsy material stored for prolonged periods during which post-mortem changes may have occurred. 
 Iron and lipid peroxidation are believed to be involved in the degeneration of pigmented neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 The aim of the review is a brief description of the present status of research and perspectives in the field of multiple dopamine receptors, as well as of the importance of new discoveries for the treatment of schizophrenic psychoses and Parkinson's disease. 
These studies have prompted a number of hypotheses which open new perspectives for investigation into pathophysiology and therapy of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
The results show that forelimb stepping is a highly useful test to monitor lesion-/and transplant-induced changes in forelimb akinesia, a behavioral parameter that may be analogous to limb akinesia and gait problems seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Brainstem Lewy bodies (LB) are neuronal inclusions that are closely related to Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Since this result promised to provide a behavioral animal model for pre-clinical Parkinson's disease, we hoped to delineate the responsible receptor by challenging with selective D1- and D2-agonists. 
 Alterations in complex I activity, one of the enzymatic units of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, have been demonstrated in different tissues from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Positron tomography, using [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa as a tracer, has been used for the study of Parkinson's disease. 
Reduced striatal uptake of the tracer was demonstrated in a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
These findings may partly explain the limited efficacy of L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Sleep deprivation has previously been reported to result in a temporary improvement of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease patients. 
This lesion model, the induction of a partial dopamine denervation of the striatum (74% depletion of dopamine striatal tissue content) with a retrograde degeneration of dopamine cell bodies in the substantia nigra, sparing the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, closely approximates the neuronal degeneration observed in human idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Such chromaffin cell-derived neurons are, however, functionally ineffective in this rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent data indicate that full D1 dopamine agonists have greater antiparkinsonian effects in the MPTP primate model than do partial agonists, suggesting that the intrinsic activity of D1 agonists may affect their utility in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
This pattern of impairment which is also found in early stages of Parkinson's disease is likely to be due to deficiency of striatal dopamine. 
In the present study, the apparent 'recovery' in [3H]mazindol binding in the rostroventral caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens may indicate regeneration of dopamine neurone terminals in these regions and this may contribute to the behavioural recovery seen in this primate model of Parkinson's disease. 
 In addition to motor impairment, non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit a variable degree of cognitive impairment which could indicate dysfunction in the central executive of working memory. 
 The mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of redox-active brain iron in normal senescence and in Parkinson's disease remain poorly understood. 
The results of this study suggest that stress-related trapping of nonheme iron by astroglial mitochondria may be an important mechanism underlying the pathological accumulation of redox-active iron in the basal ganglia of subjects with Parkinson's disease. 
 The recent availability of selective ligands for NMDA and AMPA receptors has enabled neuroscientists to test the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease is a glutamate hyperactivity disorder and hence treatable with glutamate antagonists. 
Monotherapy of Parkinson's disease with glutamate antagonists appears impractical at the present time, due to their low efficacy and unacceptable side effects, but polypharmacy with L-DOPA and a glutamate antagonist as adjuvant is a more realistic prospect. 
 The optimal combination of a dopamine D2 agonist and a D1 agonist was evaluated for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings suggest that combination therapy with a partial D2 agonist and a full D1 agonist or monotherapy with a dopamine agonist that has both partial D2 and full D1 agonist properties might be beneficial for treating motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease without inducing dopaminergic side effects. 
These findings may be of relevance for developmental diseases in which dopaminergic mechanisms have been implicated, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
Considering the pivotal role for DA receptors in the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (PD), these interactions might be clinically relevant. 
 Deprenyl is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor and has been used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on 15 patients with Parkinsonian syndromes: 11 with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD), 3 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 1 with postencephalitic Parkinsonism (SPP). 
Parkinson's disease is one of the most common movement disorders and is related to destruction of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the basal ganglia. 
Although beta C+s appear to be less specific toxins than MPP+, their levels in human substantia nigra are 8-20-fold higher than in cortex, making their role as relatively selective nigral toxins in Parkinson's disease plausible. 
 A wide variety of drugs is available for treating Parkinson's disease, including anticholinergics, amantadine levodopa, dopamine agonists, and selegiline. 
 Iodine-123-beta-CIT is a SPECT radioligand for dopamine and 5-HT transporters with potential use in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and cocaine addiction studies. 
 The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between D2 dopamine receptor density and levodopa dosage, disease duration and dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: Iodine-123-iodobenzamide SPECT scans were obtained from 14 PD patients and 12 age-matched controls using a three-headed camera in conjunction with MRI and a fiducial-based image registration system to define regions of interest. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative progressive disorder with a prevalence of 1% in the population above 65 years of age. 
Thus, Parkinson's disease (PD) is 5 times less common than senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT). 
It reviews the present possibilities to diagnose Parkinson's disease clinically and with pharmacological and imaging techniques. 
As 10-30% of Parkinson's disease patients become demented in the course of the disease, the question is addressed, how Parkinson's disease relates to SDAT. 
In addition, it is discussed, whether a global or focal deficit of cognitive function is present in Parkinson's disease. 
This technique may allow to diagnose Parkinson's disease in the very early clinical and may be even preclinical phase. 
 Bromocriptine, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, has widely been used for patients with Parkinson's disease. 
With other available ligands for the muscarinic cholinergic receptors and [18F] fluorodopa, we started clinical investigations to document the state of neurotransmission in patients with epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. 
The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if baby hamster kidney cells engineered to secrete glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (BHK-GDNF) would survive encapsulation and implantation in a dopamine-depleted rodent striatum, (2) compare polymer-encapsulated PC12 and PC12A cells in terms of their ability to survive and produce catecholamines in vivo in a dopamine-depleted striatum, and (3) determine if BHK-GDNF, PC12, or PC12A cells reduce parkinsonian symptoms in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease. 
The results suggest that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system might be selectively vulnerable to 3-NPA and demonstrate that it is possible to employ 3-NPA in a model of partial lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system resembling early stages of Parkinson's disease. 
 Experimental and clinical studies indicate that both dopamine D2-like and D1-like receptors are important in reversing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and therefore stimulation of both D1 and D2 receptors may be advantageous in its treatment. 
The production of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease might reflect an imbalance in the D1-direct and D2-indirect GABAergic output pathways from the caudate-putamen, which colocalize tachykinins and enkephalins, respectively. 
Dopamine agonist drugs also might exert neuroprotective actions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The main pathologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease is a degeneration of the dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra, pars compacta and--to a lesser extent--in the ventral tegmental area. 
Our results with pergolide as monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease also are discussed. 
The EAND model suggests that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in SN can be caused by immune-mediated processes, which may help our understanding of the pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinsonism occurs in approximately 35 to 40% of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) even with little or no neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra, which in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) results in the severe loss of striatal dopamine transporter sites. 
These results are similar to our recent data showing marked decreases in TH mRNA type 1, 2, 3 and 4 content in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease, and suggest that MPTP-treated monkeys closely replicate changes in TH isoforms in human Parkinson's disease. 
 A high survival rate of grafted dopamine neurons is crucial for reversing neurological deficits following brain tissue transplantation in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) accounts for 58% of patients with Parkinsonism. 
 N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents in different neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease. 
Moreover, 'poor debrisoquine metabolizer' phenotype is significantly increased in Parkinson's disease patients. 
Our results suggest that dopamine differentiation factors may be important in regulating the production of dopamine in the injured brain and, therefore, may be useful in the treatment of DA imbalances associated with certain neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
 We measured homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA), and tryptophan (TP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 20 neuroleptic-free patients with Huntington's disease (HD), and compared mean values with those from four control groups including 15 normal individuals, 38 patients with dystonia, 23 untreated patients with Parkinson's disease, and 61 patients with other neurological diseases (ONDs). 
We used remoxipride in the management of nine patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were experiencing visual hallucinations due to dopaminergic therapy. 
 Clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease do not appear until almost total depletion of dopamine has occurred in the striatum, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to offset the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. 
It is possible that prostaglandin H synthase is responsible for the oxidation of dopamine and formation of neuromelanin in vivo, which may have implications for the development of Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, drugs such as aspirin that modulate the activity of this enzyme may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of Parkinson's disease. 
 To predicate the value of human fetal substantia nigra transplantation in clinical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), dissociated cells of substantia nigra from 8-12 week old abortive human fetus were grafted into the neostriatum of 5 adult rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism induced by unilateral injection of MPTP. 
 The effects of co-administration of quinpirole with benzazepine D1 dopamine (DA) agonists possessing full/supramaximal (SKF 80723 and SKF 82958), partial (SKF 38393 and SKF 75670) and no efficacies (SKF 83959) in stimulating adenylate cyclase (AC) were investigated in rodent and primate models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The purpose of this study was to determine the plasma level of clozapine and its metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine, in Parkinson's disease patients with L-DOPA-induced psychosis responsive to clozapine. 
Possible mechanisms that may account for clozapine's antipsychotic action in dopaminomimetic-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease, including serotonin2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D4 receptor blockade, at plasma levels that would be ineffective in refractory schizophrenia, are discussed. 
 In an era when the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing because our population is aging, eye care professionals need to become aware of the visual changes experienced by PD patients. 
Because acetylcholinesterase and dopamine are co-released from the neurons degenerating in Parkinson's disease, a direct chemical interaction between these two molecules could have significance both for the normal functioning of the substantia nigra and for related pathological states. 
 Local cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the steady state and after intravenous administration of levodopa (1 mg/kg) was measured by xenon-enhanced computed tomography in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 16), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 6), olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA, n = 5), and arteriosclerotic parkinsonism (AP, n = 7). 
 To clarify the roles of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's disease, antiparkinsonian effects of various dopamine agonists in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned parkinsonian monkeys were investigated with regard to induction of hyperactivity such as excitability, irritability and aggressiveness. 
Recent work has produced a primate model of Parkinson's disease for study of its pathogenesis and treatment. 
In the last two decades, administration of dopamine agonist has been the mainstay of treatment of Parkinson's disease in the humans. 
plays a role in MPTP neurotoxicity as well as novel therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease. 
 A unilateral partially lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease was developed following selective lesioning of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta by stereotactic injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine. 
These results support the utility of unilateral partially lesioned rat models of Parkinson's disease for studies investigating a host sprouting or upregulation response and confirm that the immunostained striatal fibers originate from spared dopamine neurons in the ventromedial midbrain. 
We conclude that intracerebral GDNF administration exerts both protective and reparative effects on the nigrostriatal dopamine system, which may have implications for the development of new treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease. 
The results suggest that the potentiation by NMDA receptor antagonists of motor activity induced by dopaminergic agonists in animal models of Parkinson's disease cannot be ascribed simply to increased release of dopamine. 
Anticipating on the results of ongoing transplantation studies in rat, they suggest that pig fetal VM can be a suitable alternative for the use of fetal human VM as a graft for Parkinson's disease. 
 There has been much speculation of late as to whether antagonists of glutamate receptors can be used to combat the motor difficulties of Parkinson's disease, either as monotherapy, or as polytherapy to boost the effects of conventional L-DOPA treatment. 
 Disturbances of the dopamine system are involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The possible relevance of these findings for the treatment of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 The present review brings the survey of the most frequently used behavioural tests in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
TH may be closely related to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, such as dystonia and Parkinson's disease, psychiatric diseases, such as affective disorders and schizophrenia, as well as cardiovascular diseases. 
The TH gene may prove useful in gene therapy to compensate for decreased levels of catecholamines in neurological diseases, for example, for supplementation of dopamine in Parkinson's disease. 
 Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and control subjects were given two types of time estimation task. 
 After almost 30 years amantadines have reached a definite position in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
A monotherapy with amantadine is indicated in the early phase of Parkinson's disease and in cases of slight symptoms. 
With additional knowledge about the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and about the role of the neurotoxicity though glutamate amantadines as NMDA-receptor antagonists become a great importance as neuroprotective substances. 
To answer the question about the putative relevance of 6-OHDA endogenously formed in the brain for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), the chemical mechanisms leading to dopamine-coordinative complexes were investigated in vitro. 
These results suggest that increased intracellular cAMP protects dopaminergic neurons in situations of stress and therefore reveal novel possibilities for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 This review focuses on two restorative strategies against Parkinson's disease: (1) intrastriatal implantation of fetal dopamine producing cells and (2) application of neurotrophic factors. 
(1) Neuronal transplantation of dopaminergic embryonic ventral mesencephalic cells aims at compensating the striatal dopamine deficit in Parkinson's disease. 
(2) Neurotrophic factor therapy relates to the prevention and/or restoration of the progressing nigral cell loss in Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, the Lazaroid U-74389G seems to be beneficial in this model of Parkinson's disease. 
These in vivo data add further evidence to suggest that deprenyl, a putative and clinically unproven neuroprotective agent, may be of value in slowing the progressive nigral degeneration in "early" Parkinson's disease, but may prove to be less so in its terminal stages. 
Free radical formation and subsequent lipid peroxidation had been postulated to participate broadly to the pathogenesis of tissue injury, including the brain injury induced by hypoxia, ischemia or trauma, as well as in the physiopathology of chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. 
The neuroprotective action of dihydroergocryptine suggests a potential usefulness in halting the acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases related to excitotoxic damage and free radical formation, including Parkinson's disease. 
In 12 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with motor fluctuations, cabergoline was added in an 8-week study to their usual L-dopa/carbidopa therapy. 
 The addition of a dopamine agonist and of a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor to I-dopa has been suggested in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 In the last 20 years dopamine agonists have been considered more and more helpful as primary therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The rationale for dopamine (DA) agonists as primary therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on the possibility to delay the onset of long term I-dopa syndrome (LTS) (King, 1992); moreover DA agonists seem to exert a neuroprotective effect on substantia nigra neurons. 
 Ropinirole is a novel, non-ergoline dopamine agonist chemical name with a very high specificity for dopamine D2-like receptors, currently being investigated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The efficacy of ropinirole has been investigated in three placebo-controlled studies: one using ropinirole as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and two using it as an adjunct to L-dopa in patients who are experiencing fluctuations in motor response. 
 We evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, pramipexole [(S)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-propylamino-benzathiazol-dihydro chloride], as adjunctive therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Dopamine agonists (DAGs) were first used in patients with moderate or advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
While many DAGs have been developed, only four have been marketed and are used extensively for the treatment of Parkinson's disease: apomorphine, bromocriptine, lisuride and pergolide. 
This pharmacodynamic characteristic seems the most effective in increasing the motility in Parkinson's disease. 
Our group has recently investigated the effect of sublingual administration of apomorphine in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
Further clinical studies using either more efficient (tablets with faster dissolution) and better tolerated sublingual formulations or other dopamine agonists should be carried on before recommending this approach in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The utility of apomorphine in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well asserted but its clinical use is reduced because of its short half-life and numerous side-effects. 
 Single photon emission tomography with the ligand [123I]-IBZM was used to image central dopamine D2 receptors in Parkinson's disease patients. 
Our results indicate that striatal D2 receptor alterations in Parkinson's disease may contribute to the altered response to L-Dopa. 
 Dopa-induced "peak dose" dyskinesia (DID) observed during the treatment of Parkinson's disease patients has traditionally been linked primarily to dopamine D1 receptor-mediated mechanisms. 
 When the nigrostriatal projection is partially destroyed in Parkinson's disease, remaining neurons fire more rapidly and accelerate synthesis and release of dopamine (DA) from endogenous tyrosine and levodopa. 
Therefore, utilization of levodopa does not seem to depend on the state of discharge rates of nigral neurons and effect of levodopa and DA agonists in Parkinson's disease is additive. 
 Cognitive changes have long been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease: visuo-spatial deficits, memory disorders, dysexecutive syndrome. 
Spread of pathology is extremely slow in the juvenile or early onset parkinsonism (JP) compared with that in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Combinations of dopaminergic agonists with glutamate receptor antagonists have been suggested to be a possible alternative treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that agents, blocking the ion-channel of the NMDA receptor, might be useful adjuvants to some but not all dopaminomimetics in therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) of variable intensity eventually emerge in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients chronically treated with standard oral levodopa. 
This model supports the hypothesis that more continuous forms of dopaminomimetic therapy represent the best therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease and calls for the development of novel D1 agonists for further clinical testing. 
In Parkinson's disease AAAD is the rate-controlling enzyme for the synthesis of DA when L-DOPA is administered and any change of AAAD activity could have clinical consequences. 
Studies are presented demonstrating how AAAD activity can be enhanced in an animal model of Parkinson's disease and how rapid fluctuations of AAAD can be provoked via second messenger system activation. 
 Neuronal transplantation of dopaminergic embryonic ventral mesencephalic cells aims at replacing the lost striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease. 
This review highlights some of the progress made in the field of ventral mesencephalic transplantation in animal models of Parkinson's disease and also discusses issues and results obtained by our own research group in Munich. 
 The first results on functional effects induced by embryonic nigral grafts in the rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) were reported in the late 70 s. 
 A new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is based on providing trophic support for degenerating dopaminergic (DA) neurons. 
 Seven patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were enrolled in a ten week study to evaluate the efficacy of famotidine, an histamine H2-antagonist, in the treatment of bradyphrenia. 
 The expression of proenkephalin (PENK), prodynorphin (PDYN) and c-fos genes was studied in the striatum of C57B1/6 mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6,-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which are used as a rodent model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We recorded short latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median nerve stimuli in 40 patients affected by idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) classified from I to IV on the Hoehn and Yahr disability scale. 
 Apomorphine is a dopamine receptor agonist increasingly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We measured the levels of dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein, and dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase (DDC) protein in the striatum of 10 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 23 patients with dominantly inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA). 
 We report the possible existence of an inhibitory factor in the CSF of Parkinson's disease patients that inhibits the function and growth of dopaminergic neurons in rat mesencephalic culture. 
 We evaluated the effects of mianserin, a relatively selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, on symptoms related to drug-induced psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinsonism has been reported to improve following transplantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue into the striatum of MPTP-exposed monkeys and humans and in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Some patients with basal ganglia disease (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease) have alterations in pain sensation in addition to motor abnormalities. 
 Manganese is an essential trace element for human metabolism, but at higher concentrations it is a potent neurotoxin that presents clinical symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease. 
Its current uses include the treatment of Parkinson's disease, postpartum ablaction, prolactinomas, acromegaly, and amenorrhea and galactorrhea secondary to neuroleptic use. 
 We studied the mechanisms of dopamine receptor agonist- and L-DOPA-mediated supersensitization in experimental Parkinson's disease model rats, by measuring in vivo acetylcholine (ACh) release, GTPase activities, and mRNA expression in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats. 
These findings suggest that there is supersensitization of D1 and D2/D3 receptors in the experimental Parkinson's disease model, while the upregulation of their receptors or GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) to be coupled to their receptors is unlikely involved in major parts of such mechanisms. 
 Clinicians have long associated Parkinson's disease (PD) with personality traits such as seriousness and industriousness. 
Damage of these neurons in the substantia nigra zona compacta (SNc) is considered as the cause of Parkinson's disease. 
 Post-mortem neurochemical studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown that, in addition to the typical nigro-striatal dopamine denervation, there exists a concomitant neocortical monoamine fibre deafferentation (of variable severity) whose role in motor, and especially in associated cognitive and affective impairment, remains elusive. 
 The clinical use of fetal neural grafts as an intracerebral source of dopamine for patients with Parkinson's disease has met with limited success. 
Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) enhances the survival and growth of dopaminergic neurons in vitro, we explored whether cells genetically modified to produce bFGF would improve the functional efficacy of dopaminergic neurons implanted into rats with experimental Parkinson's disease. 
Considered at the level of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons, whose degeneration is responsible for the Parkinson's disease, this carrier seems to constitute a major target. 
These agents by inhibiting the dopamine reuptake, could also lessen extrapyramidal troubles as well as the depressive manifestations which are frequently associated to Parkinson's disease. 
 Fetal ventral mesencephalic grafts have been used as a tool to counteract the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Nitric oxide appears to be necessary for hydroxyl free radical generation in MPP+ toxicity and may play a role in neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent research on the role of clozapine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders is discussed. 
Most clinical trials have shown resolution of or improvement in psychotic symptoms accompanying Parkinson's disease without worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. 
Most of these studies have serious limitations, however; until better studies have been completed, the decision to use clozapine for Parkinson's disease-related psychosis should be made on a case-by-case basis, with thorough evaluation of risks, benefits, and other therapeutic options. 
Some patients with Parkinson's disease have shown improvement in tremor and other abnormal movements when given clozapine. 
Clozapine has shown some efficacy as a treatment for psychosis and abnormal movements in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is thought to be caused by a combination of unknown environmental, genetic, and degenerative factors. 
Evidence from necropsy brain samples and pharmacokinetics suggests involvement of dopamine receptors in the pathogenesis or pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
Genetic association studies between Parkinson's disease and dopamine D2, D3 and D4 receptor gene polymorphisms were conducted. 
The polymorphism was examined in 71 patients with Parkinson's disease and 90 controls. 
Our findings do not support the hypothesis that susceptibility to Parkinson's disease is associated with the dopamine receptor polymorphisms examined. 
These results support clinical findings that despite long-term use of l-deprenyl for the treatment of Parkinson's disease by large numbers of patients, no instances of abuse have been documented. 
Because Parkinson's disease is characterized by a decrease in dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia, the selective inhibition of MAO-B should lead to diminished metabolism of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system and a significant increase in the concentration of the neurotransmitter. 
MAO-B inhibition explains the clinical efficacy of l-deprenyl in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the prevention of the conversion of protoxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which is oxidized by MAO-B and can cause a parkinsonian syndrome, to their active neurotoxin. 
 The acetylenic selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B suicide inhibitor, l-deprenyl (l-selegiline), has proved to be a useful adjuvant to L-dopa therapy and monotherapy of Parkinson's disease. 
The increased life expectancy noted in patients with Parkinson's disease who received long-term therapy (9 years in an uncontrolled study) is another unexpected feature of the drug. 
More recent studies indicate that Parkinson's disease may eventually turn out to be a neurotoxic event resulting from oxidative stress-induced free radical species in the substantia nigra. 
 PET studies were carried out on brain dopamine D1 receptors using two new ligands, [11C]SCH 39166 and [11C]NNC 756.METHODS: Four normal subjects and eight predominantly unilateral patients with early Parkinson's disease were investigated. 
 OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the very long-acting dopamine agonist medication cabergoline in the control of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
PATIENTS: Volunteer sample of 41 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who were experiencing motor fluctuations while receiving stable doses of carbidopa and levodopa. 
CONCLUSIONS: Cabergoline improved motor control in patients with Parkinson's disease who were experiencing clinical fluctuations. 
The results showed that degeneration of the dopaminergic terminals in the striatum may lead to cell death of the parent cell bodies in the SN and suggest that the striatum may be the initial site in which the neurodegeneration occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
 It has been suggested that levodopa (L-dopa), a dopamine precursor used to treat Parkinson's disease, may be toxic to grafted fetal neuroblasts; if so, the use of the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor selegiline might prevent such toxicity. 
We therefore conclude that, in the unilaterally lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease, there is no adverse effect of L-dopa nor any significant effect of selegiline, either alone or coadministered with L-dopa, on behavioral recovery induced by fetal ventral mesencephalic grafts. 
 The parkinsonian syndromes include idiopathic Parkinson's disease, parkinsonian syndromes secondary to several known causative agents, and parkinsonian syndromes associated with more widespread CNS lesions and extensive neurologic deficits. 
These results show that the intrastriatal infusion of lisuride reverses the behavioural and D2-dopamine receptor changes present in the 6-OHDA lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
MAO-B inhibitors are useful adjunct drugs to 1-DOPA in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Interestingly, 1-deprenyl alone can slow down the progress of otherwise disabled syndromes of Parkinson's disease. 
In animal models of Parkinson's disease, the improvement resulting from transplantation is dependent on the number of surviving grafted dopamine neurons and the density and extent of graft-derived reinnervation. 
The major unresolved scientific question at present is not whether neural grafting is better than established drug treatments but if survival and function of such grafts are at all possible in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
[123I] beta-CIT is a potential marker of the dopamine and serotonin transporters and can be used to study the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders. 
In addition, the selective loss of dopamine in the putamen but not the caudate parallels the regional vulnerability observed in Parkinson's disease, an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, raising the possibility of a relationship between normal aging and the development of this disease. 
 One therapeutic approach to treating Parkinson's disease is to convert endogenous striatal cells into levo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa)-producing cells. 
A defective herpes simplex virus type 1 vector expressing human tyrosine hydroxylase was delivered into the partially denervated striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, used as a model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentanoic acid (CGP 37849) and D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), and the non-competitive NMDA antagonists, memantine and amantadine, which are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, were tested for their effects on intrastriatally evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in rat neostriatal slices. 
These results demonstrate neurochemical and behavioral improvements in unilaterally DA-lesioned rats following intranigral administration of GDNF, suggesting that GDNF may develop into a useful therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
It could also pave the way for the research and development of novel neuroprotective antioxidants and strategies for the early or preventive treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (Wu et al., this issue), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, head trauma, and possibly Alzheimer's cognitive dysfunction as well. 
These findings indicate that the cytotoxic hydroxyl radical generated from dopamine oxidation in the iron-rich basal ganglia may contribute to the mechanism underlying the selective A9 melanized nigral degeneration in MPTP-Parkinsonism and possibly in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, based on the present data, a possible neuroprotective therapeutic window of deprenyl in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease has been proposed. 
Moreover, a combination of early detection of individuals at risk of developing Parkinson's disease and early intervention of deprenyl and/or other centrally active antioxidants to these patients may provide a new preventive therapeutic strategy in the future, in addition to the current conventional levodopa treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 A 64-year-old man was diagnosed to have Parkinson's disease when aged 42 years and since then has been treated with levodopa and benserazide (up to 875 mg daily). 
 BACKGROUND: The reactivity of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the striatum is preserved in Parkinson's disease (PD) but not in parkinsonian syndromes of various origin (PS). 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may share certain abnormalities since a subset of PD patients suffer from dementia, and some AD individuals show extrapyramidal symptoms. 
In parallel, patients with Parkinson's disease and other extrapyramidal disorders, who are under administration of dopaminergic drugs, often present with abnormal findings with respect to immune parameters. 
 The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by an increase in activity of striatal neurons which project to the globus pallidus. 
The loss of nigrostriatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease allows the cortical glutamatergic input to dominate (see Fig. 
Abnormalities of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons cause motor impairment leading to Parkinson's disease, whereas dysfunction of mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurons are most implicated in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and in drug addition. 
Narabayashi (Juntendo Univ.) found that NE-D develops in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), that a freezing phenomenon in these patients might be associated with NE-D, and that L-DOPS improves the phenomenon. 
 Pergolide (Permax, LY127809, CAS 66104-23-2) a dopamine agonist for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, was evaluated for reproductive and developmental toxicity. 
The F1 mice of the 15- and 50-ppm groups remained smaller than the control mice until termination at approximately 20 weeks of age, although weight gains following weaning were not depressed and no impairment of mating performance or fertility was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  At present, the pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) consists mainly of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and/or dopamine D2 receptor agonists. 
At the neuropathologic level, Parkinson's disease is characterized by an overshoot of striatal cholinergic transmission due to the decreased inhibitory dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. 
 Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using the stable xenon enhanced CT method in previously untreated 13 patients with Parkinson's disease to evaluate CBF abnormality related to dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. 
1) No significant CBF asymmetry was noted in any of the striatum, pallidum, thalamus, cerebrum, cerebellum and frontal lobe in untreated patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 We report one case of parkinsonism induced by cisapride and one case of Parkinson's disease whose symptoms were worsened by cisapride. 
A 66-year-old female with Parkinson's disease was given cisapride for constipation. 
in Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
These results suggest that talipexole is a selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist drug of potential use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Regarding clinical diagnoses it was not possible to differentiate between advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IP) and Parkinsonism of other aetiology (OP) on the basis of 123I-IBZM SPECT. 
It is suggested that the reason for the susceptibility of pigment epithelial function to dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease may be due to the pigment epithelium being at the extremity of the diffusion pathway from dopamine release sites at the inner plexiform layer. 
 Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition of unknown cause and with no known cure. 
Careful evaluation in necessary to help distinguish Parkinson's disease from secondary causes of parkinsonism. 
Nineteen patients were clinically diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease, two patients presented with atypical parkinsonism (i.e. 
clinical signs of Parkinson's disease and a subsequent poor response to dopamimetic drugs) and one patient was diagnosed as having Wilson's disease. 
However, when only those 19 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and increased specific 11C-raclopride binding were considered, no significant correlation was obtained. 
For the treatment of Parkinson's disease, L-DOPA therapy has been applied to replace dopamine, and droxidopa (L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine) therapy to supply noradrenaline (NA). 
By application for Parkinson's disease, it alleviated neurological symptoms such as freezing phenomenon, which are refractory to L-DOPA. 
The relevance to long-term potentiation, reinforcement learning, and Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 The recent history of neural transplantation using the adrenal medulla parallels an evolution in our thinking about neural grafting as a therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
 This paper reviews the literature describing the condition of the adrenal medulla in Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized primarily by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. 
Clinical observations have revealed that Parkinson's disease is also frequently accompanied by a variety of autonomic symptoms. 
However, until recently this organ has not been of particular interest in Parkinson's disease. 
In the late 1980s adrenal medullary tissue was first transplanted to the caudate nucleus in an attempt to augment the decreased levels of dopamine, and thus treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, the adrenal medulla appears to be a target of the peripheral manifestations of Parkinson's disease. 
These results suggest that genetically modified astrocytes promote the prolonged survival and function of adrenal chromaffin cell grafts in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
Detailed knowledge of the anatomy and subtype specificity of glutamate receptors is important both in understanding the normal physiology of basal ganglia neurotransmission and the pathophysiological changes occurring in diseases affecting the basal ganglia such as Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may sometimes be misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease in its early stages, hence an early positive diagnosis of PSP based on dopamine D2 receptor density could be extremely valuable. 
This suggests that early introduction of bromocriptine in the therapy of Parkinson's disease may be superior to treatment with L-DOPA alone. 
When antioxidant defence mechanisms are defective, as in chronic vitamin E deficiency, the nigrostriatal pathway may be affected by oxidative damage and this may have implications for Parkinson's disease. 
 OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in activity and immobility during sleep between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy subjects and to evaluate the relations of clinical variables with the motor activity measures in patients with PD. 
 There is evidence to suggest that degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease and certain other conditions results from the action of reactive species generated during the oxidation of dopamine. 
 The motor effects of the partial dopamine agonist (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-n-propylpiperidine [(-)-3-PPP, preclamol] were evaluated in nine patients with Parkinson's disease using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. 
 Pharmacotherapy with levodopa for Parkinson's disease provides symptomatic benefit, but fluctuations in (or loss of) response may eventually occur. 
The cause of Parkinson's disease may relate to oxidant stress and the generation of free radicals. 
It is not clear whether treatment with selegiline hydrochloride (a type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor) delays the progression of Parkinson's disease, because the drug also exerts a mild symptomatic effect. 
Pharmacological strategies to stimulate DA synthesis and release in moderately advanced Parkinson's disease should be pursued. 
In the first clinical studies in patients with Parkinson's disease, both entacapone and tolcapone potentiate and prolong the therapeutic effect of L-dopa. 
Similar regulation of striatal neurons in vivo may contribute to dopaminergic regulation of basal ganglia output and the ability of dopaminomimetic agents to ameliorate symptoms of dopaminergic deficiency in Parkinson's disease. 
 Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane) has therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease and dementia. 
Unraveling the trophic anatomy of BDNF will aid in understanding its role in development, degeneration, and experimental animal models of regeneration providing essential data for its use in clinical neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease. 
This review will present some of the experimental evidence indicating a role of disturbed iron metabolism as a cause of the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  The effects of bifemelane on parkinsonism were shown in MPTP-treated common marmosets. 
These results indicate that it is worth studying the effects of bifemelane hydrochloride on patients with Parkinson's disease. 
This action of nicotine may be of interest in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD), a compensatory increase in dopamine (DA) turnover occurs in the remaining nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, resulting in greater exposure of each neuron to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) derived from oxidative deamination of DA. 
Pharmacologic manipulation of the transport of levodopa from blood to brain may offer a new strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We report a patient with Meige syndrome (segmental cranial dystonia) who had neuropathologic changes of Parkinson's disease on postmortem examination. 
 Auditory event related potentials (ERPs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded from eight patients with Parkinson's disease, before and after a single dose of apomorphine. 
These data suggest that apomorphine induces, besides its motor effects in patients with Parkinson's disease, a slowing down of cognitive processing. 
Moreover, they could be employed as a tool in Parkinson's disease, migraine, schizophrenia and hypertension research. 
Patients were excluded if: there was no informed consent; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding; allergies were being treated with antihistamines; drug addiction was present or convulsions or Parkinson's disease; any pre- or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered. 
Concepts of NMS have changed because medications other than classic neuroleptic drugs have been implicated as triggering agents and because syndromes identical to NMS have been observed in patients with Parkinson's disease withdrawn from their medication or suffering akinetic hyperthermic parkinsonian crisis. 
 This article reviews new medical and surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The transplantation of neuronal tissue into the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease is already being assessed as an experimental treatment for the symptoms of this disease, and the possibility of using similar graft tissue to ameliorate the symptoms of other neurodegenerative diseases is being considered. 
This novel means to deliver these substances to the central nervous system could be of therapeutic usefulness in Parkinson's disease. 
 The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are tremors, hypokinesia, rigidity, and abnormal posture, caused by degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and deficiency of DA in the neostriatal dopaminergic terminals. 
 The cardinal neurochemical abnormality in Parkinson's disease is the decreased dopamine content in the striatum, resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon. 
By contrast, the neurons that survive in Parkinson's disease are free of neuromelanin, calbindinD28-positive, contain low amounts of iron, and are better protected against oxidative stress. 
The analysis of the pattern of cell loss in Parkinson's disease may thus bring new clues as to the mechanism of nerve cell death in Parkinson's disease. 
 Changes in neurotransmission are known to take place in a variety of conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been used to support the hypothesis that the striatum serves procedural learning but interpretation of the results is confounded by extra-striate pathology and coincidental non-procedural cognitive deficits. 
 Intracerebral co-grafting of Schwann's cells and human fetal adrenal medullary tissue was performed in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Reaction time (RT) and movement time (MT) are reported to be delayed in Parkinson's disease (PD), but their clinical utility and relationship with clinical findings is still uncertain. 
These results demonstrate that monoamine-activated alpha 2M is capable of producing significant degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in vivo and suggest that this factor may play a role in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system results in marked disorders of movement such as occur in Parkinson's disease. 
The pattern of striatal DA loss characteristic of Parkinson's disease can be reproduced to a certain extent in MPTP-intoxicated primates. 
 Soon after the successful introduction of large oral doses of levodopa or of levodopa plus a decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa or benserazide, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, it became evident that several disturbing side effects were limiting the therapeutic efficacy of this amino acid. 
 Major motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease during levodopa treatment include "wearing-off" fluctuations, "on-off" fluctuations, freezing, and early morning dystonia. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease generally have a smooth clinical response from levodopa therapy for the first 3 to 5 years. 
Finally, erratic motor responses (eg, the "on-off" phenomenon) in advanced Parkinson's disease may be caused in part by alterations at the striatal dopamine receptor. 
 We studied cerebral dopamine D2-receptor binding using [11C]raclopride and PET in 18 previously untreated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 14 healthy volunteer subjects. 
 Wearing-off phenomenon that complicates levodopa therapy of Parkinson's disease has been attributed to a reduction in striatal dopamine storage due to the progressive degeneration of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals. 
 The association between degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system and the motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) provided the impetus for the development of DA replacement therapy. 
The vulnerability pattern in the mesencephalon of weaver mutants bears similarities to that described in idiopathic Parkinson's disease or in N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Parkinsonism: Calbindin-D28k may thus delimit a group of dopaminergic neurons resistant to cell death in different conditions. 
On the other hand, the vulnerability pattern of dopaminergic fibers in weaver differs from that of Parkinson's disease, since there is a complete sparing of the dopaminergic mesocortical projection in weaver, contrasting with the damage of these projections in Parkinson's disease. 
 The specific binding of [3H]neurotensin, [3H]substance P, [3H]D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin (delta receptors) and [3H]-Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(NMe)Phe-Gly-ol (mu receptors) were studied in membrane preparations of caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra from patients with Parkinson's disease and from age-matched controls. 
Substance P receptors were reduced in the putamen (anterior and posterior) and in lateral globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease. 
This method to deliver substances to the CNS will be tested for therapeutic usefulness in patients with Parkinson's disease, in a recently approved clinical trial in Göteborg. 
 Dopamine receptors are the primary targets in the treatment of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's chorea, and are discussed in this review by Philip Seeman and Hubert Van Tol. 
 When grafting human mesencephalic tissue to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, the number of surviving dopamine (DA) neurons in the graft is probably crucial. 
These findings suggest that cryopreservation, using the current technique, is not a suitable storage method for use in clinical trials of DA neuron grafting in Parkinson's disease. 
 The purpose of this work was to characterize the human foetal adrenal gland (HFAG) by studying norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (DA) levels in foetuses with ages ranging from 10 to 18 weeks, as a source of chromaffin cells for basic and clinical research, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The effect of DBQ (10-20 mg) administration on pHVA in young healthy volunteers was studied to establish a protocol for use in de novo patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Subsequently, pHVA in de novo patients with Parkinson's disease were measured and compared to young healthy volunteers. 
pHVA was reduced in both de novo patients with Parkinson's disease and in healthy volunteers following DBQ (10 mg) administration. 
These results suggest that, following DBQ administration, pHVA does not reflect dopamine neuronal loss in de novo patients with Parkinson's disease, so it is unlikely to detect the disease before the clinical symptoms manifest themselves. 
Parenteral apomorphine has been used in Parkinson's disease (PD) to replace levodopa after surgery or to treat the malignant syndrome brought about by sudden levodopa withdrawal. 
Six and one-tenth percent of essential tremor patients had concomitant Parkinson's disease, 6.9% had a coexisting dystonia, and 1.8% had myoclonus. 
It is concluded that the frequency of Parkinson's disease in essential tremor is more than would be reported in the general population and that other movement disorders are infrequently observed in essential tremor. 
 OBJECTIVE: Evaluate long-term efficacy of autologous adrenal-to-caudate transplants in idiopathic Parkinson's disease refractory to medical treatment. 
Disease progression of each patient was compared with his own preoperative course and with those of a cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease followed up for 14 years who had received medical treatment without transplant surgery. 
 More effective measures to control and replace the dopaminergic deficit of Parkinson's disease are being actively sought. 
Intermittent dopaminergic stimulation is associated with behavioural hyposensitivity both in animal models and in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
None of the available pharmacological approaches can restore the dopamine deficiency of Parkinson's disease to physiological levels. 
The present open trial was therefore conducted to determine whether the adenosine receptor-antagonist theophylline would be of value in Parkinson's disease. 
 Almost no information is available concerning the link between clinical effects of dopamine D2 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the extent of D2 receptor occupancy in the brain. 
This may have important implications for the understanding of how the nigrostriatal dopamine system influences motor control in the basal ganglia as well as for the development of optimal transplantation strategies in Parkinson's disease. 
Determining the specific cellular location for these dopamine receptors in the striatum is important to the design of drug treatments for disorders with suspected dopaminergic involvement such as Parkinson's disease. 
 The motor responses of 14 patients with Parkinson's disease (six previously untreated and eight chronically receiving levodopa) with pronounced asymmetry in the severity of motor signs between the left and right sides of the body were studied. 
As apomorphine is not dependent on dopamine storage capacity, these findings suggest that postsynaptic mechanisms play an important part in the origin of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
 Rats have been described as being insensitive to relatively high doses of systemically administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin that in primates induces a neurological syndrome identical to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Twelve of these patients had been treated with levodopa because of Parkinson's disease for at least 6 years, and two had been treated with methyldopa because of essential hypertension for 19 years. 
Thirty-two percent of the autopsy cases of Parkinson's disease during a recent 70-month period demonstrated pigmented rib cartilage. 
Levodopa was chromatographically demonstrated within the cartilage of patients with Parkinson's disease, but in both pigmented and unpigmented sites. 
This interpretation is consistent with the impairment in attentional set-shifting ability observed in patients with Parkinson's disease or with damage to the frontal lobes using the same test as used here for infrahuman primates. 
Most of this work has been conducted in two well-characterized animal models of striatal dysfunction: the rat model of Huntington's disease (striatal damage) and the rat model of Parkinson's disease (damage of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents). 
Such results have encouraged the clinical use of intracerebral grafts for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 It is still unclear why components of the phasic stretch reflex are increased in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This result also indicates that the severity effect in PD may be related to disruption of non-dopaminergic pathways which occurs in late-onset, but not young-onset patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Apomorphine is a potent dopamine agonist at both D1 and D2 receptors and has been used successfully for treating the 'on/off' phenomenon in Parkinson's disease. 
We report our experience with apomorphine in treating the 'on/off' phenomenon in L-dopa responsive idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Visual evoked potentials were measured on patients with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and normal controls to assess the function of dopamine and acetylcholine in the visual system. 
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter known to be present in the retina of primates and is found to be severely depleted in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The findings suggest anatomic correlates for the clinical effects of acute dopamine depletion in drug therapy and advanced Parkinson's disease in humans. 
The similarities between this primate model and the cognitive/behavioral deficits associated with early Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder suggest that this may be a useful model for testing hypotheses concerning the pharmacological treatment of these disorders. 
 Eighteen patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (n = 13) or dopamine-sensitive dystonia (n = 5) were treated with the dopaminergic agent, lisuride, applied as a long-term subcutaneous infusion. 
There was no difference between patients with dystonia and those with Parkinson's disease. 
This effect might explain the longer life expectancy and reduced proclivity for infection shown by patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These findings suggest that the long-term high-dose administration of L-dopa enhances the progression of neuronal damage in patients with injured CA neurons such as those with Parkinson's disease. 
 Fetal central nervous system transplants to the adult brain have been utilized to understand brain connectivity and as replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These data raise the additional possibility that inappropriate expression of the neurotrophins by dopaminergic neurons could contribute to the neuropathology of disease states such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
The ease of autoxidation of 8 is suggested to account for the low levels of this conjugate found in the degenerating and Parkinsonian SN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  Dopamine (DA) deficiency in Parkinson's disease is commonly treated with L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), the amino acid precursor to DA. 
 The silent period after contralateral and ipsilateral transcranial magnetic brain stimulation was studied in patients with Parkinson's disease before and after dopaminergic and anticholinergic therapy; in normal subjects before and after L-dopa administration and in patients with drug-induced parkinsonism. 
The silent period after transcranial cortical stimulation was shorter in Parkinson's disease patients than in normal subjects. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease L-dopa prolonged the silent period after transcranial brain stimulation and after ipsilateral cortical stimulation. 
In conclusion cortical silent period is abnormal in patients with Parkinson's disease and drug-induced parkinsonism. 
The results from our animal experiments may provide further evidence that impediment of 3OMD formation is meaningful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease with Madopar or levodopa. 
 We measured the time to peak antiparkinson response following injection of levodopa or apomorphine in 57 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Nigra compacta neurons surviving in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease displayed only 57% of the dopamine transporter mRNA hybridization intensity displayed by nigral neurons in normal control brains. 
 Parkinson's disease responds rather dramatically to levodopa therapy during the first several years of treatment. 
The use of selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl) has been proposed to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease; however, current evidence suggests that it is only partially effective at best, and there is no definite proof of a neuroprotective effect. 
Carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) remains the foundation of symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Excessive intracellular oxidative stress has been proposed as a cause of Parkinson's disease; however, a recent multicenter trial investigating the use of high doses of the antioxidant vitamin E showed it to be ineffective. 
We hypothesize that the decrease in estrogen improves Parkinson's disease symptoms via the relief of its antidopaminergic effects on the nigrostriatal pathway. 
 The objective of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of conventional diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease and give an overview of alternative causes to parkinsonian syndromes. 
We also propose a new approach to the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, which may improve the diagnostic accuracy. 
The available information on autopsy findings in patients clinically diagnosed as Parkinson's disease shows that 20 to 30% of these patients do not have the typical neuropathological features with Lewy bodies and cell loss in the substantia nigra. 
Based on this fact and a review of the literature on parkinsonian syndromes that may be confused with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, we propose criteria for diagnostic subgroups of the disease classified at different levels of confidence. 
The suggested diagnostic subgroups are clinical definite, probable and possible Parkinson's disease with a decreasing level of specificity and an increasing level of sensitivity in the different patient categories. 
If correct, this hypothesis may be of major importance for Parkinson's disease since it is suggested that individuals at risk of developing this neurodegenerative disorder may have lower numbers of SN TH-positive neurons to start with. 
 The mechanisms that lead ultimately to neuronal death in pathological ageing of the brain remain mostly unknown as in the case of Parkinson's disease where there is a progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. 
Biochemical studies revealed reduced dopamine in the substantia nigra and striatum (8% in the putamen and 18% of control in the caudate) with a similar but not identical subregional distribution as in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Inappropriate, dopamine-induced activation of PCD might have a role in nigral neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
With selective inhibitors of COMT in combination with L-DOPA, a new principle has been realized in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Post mortem tissue from the caudate and putamen was investigated in cases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and age matched controls. 
Significant abnormalities in Parkinson's disease included loss of benzodiazepine receptors in the mid and caudal portions of the putamen and a decrease in muscarinic receptor density in the rostral putamen in Parkinson's disease. 
 In order to determine whether, besides the severe striatal dopamine (DA) loss, other brain neurotransmitter changes may be a constant biochemical feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), we measured the concentration of the three major brain monoamines noradrenaline (NA), DA, and serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in five rostro-caudal subdivisions of the hypothalamus of eight control patients and nine patients with morphologically confirmed iPD. 
In initial clinical studies in patients with Parkinson's disease, both entacapone and tolcapone potentiated and prolonged the therapeutic effects of levodopa. 
 We report four patients with Parkinson's disease who had an unusual pattern of severe chorea and dystonia in the evenings only. 
 Pergolide (LY127809, CAS 66104-23-2), a dopamine agonist for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, was evaluated for toxicity in acute, subchronic, and chronic studies. 
Putaminal uptake was in a similar range to that seen in Parkinson's disease. 
These observations suggest that severe and prolonged vitamin E deficiency results in loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals, and support the hypothesis that oxidative stress may contribute to the etiology of Parkinson's disease. 
 It has been suggested that free radicals may adversely influence the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 Excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists have been proposed as novel therapeutic agents to be used with levopoda in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The relative lower expression of the DAT gene in VTA neurons suggests a less efficient dopamine reuptake capacity, which may partly account for the relative sparing of the mesolimbic system reported in Parkinson's disease and MPTP-treated animals. 
These results suggest that the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons may contribute to the loss of cholinergic basal forebrain function in Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that N-0923 may be useful as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We report the case of a 49-year-old woman with a therapy resistant paranoid hallucinatory psychosis and coexisting severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 We have previously demonstrated that extracts of striatal tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) increase the survival of dopamine neurons in mesencephalic cultures relative to striatal extracts from control patients. 
This degeneration is preceded, and accompanied by, cellular atrophy and a partial loss of marker enzyme expression, thus yielding an animal model which mimics the degenerative processes in Parkinson's disease more closely than the animal models available so far. 
 Evoked potential studies have confirmed visual pathway impairment in Parkinson's disease. 
These genetically modified cells, synthesizing either 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine, or both, are potential donors for treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The possible significance of these results for two clinical disorders, early Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is discussed. 
Cognitive and behavioral similarities between chronic low dose MPTP-treated monkeys, early Parkinson's disease patients and people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may suggest the existence of related pathophysiological mechanisms in these disorders. 
 The binding of [3H]GBR-12935 to dopamine (DA) uptake sites was studied in post-mortem putamen from a control group and from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). 
 We studied 10 subjects each with melancholic depression evidencing significant motor retardation (RM), Parkinson's disease (PD) with bradykinesia, and normal healthy controls (NC), matched closely for age and gender, on measurements of motor function and depression, and their performance of simple and complex ballistic movements. 
These results have important implications for the observed sex differences in clinical movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have trouble programming two separate motor acts concurrently. 
 Oral administration of L-dopa is currently the most effective way to treat the cerebral dopamine deficiency which causes Parkinson's disease. 
Unfortunately, many patients with advanced Parkinson's disease develop an unstable pattern of response to L-dopa because of fluctuating delivery of the drug to the brain. 
Nutritional factors concerning weight loss and energy balance in Parkinson's disease are also discussed. 
A set of dietary guidelines is developed to assist clinical nutritionists and neurologists in the practical management of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Our patient illustrates the advisability of searching for Strongyloides stercoralis when L-dopa malabsorption is suspected in Parkinson's disease. 
We studied apomorphine-induced increase in blood glucose levels in Parkinson's disease compared with those in Parkinsonian syndromes unresponsive to dopaminergic drugs. 
Results indicate that apomorphine-induced blood glucose level increases are significant only in Parkinson's disease. 
 We made a double-blind, crossover comparison of buspirone (10 mg orally, twice a day) and placebo in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. 
With use of DAT binding as a presynaptic marker to measure altered DA innervation, abnormalities of the DAT binding have been demonstrated in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity, and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
In Parkinson's disease, cerebrospinal fluid dopamine beta-hydroxylase was markedly diminished (16.3 +/- 2.9 versus 31.3 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, P < 0.001) and rose by 58 +/- 21% (P = 0.02) after adrenal-to-caudate chromaffin cell autografts. 
 Two patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Patients 3 and 4 in our series) were followed up to 3 years after grafting of human embryonic dopamine-rich mesencephalic tissue unilaterally into the putamen. 
We investigated whether GDN-immunoreactivity also appears in the adult at sites of synaptic rearrangement following nerve cell death and anterograde terminal degeneration in experimental models for Parkinson's disease. 
 The introduction of levodopa 25 years ago revolutionized the management of Parkinson's disease. 
A number of therapeutic strategies are available for treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Most patients with Parkinson's disease who undergo levodopa therapy eventually develop fluctuations in the diurnal control of their symptoms. 
 Fluctuations in motor performance are the major problems in chronic management of Parkinson's disease. 
We therefore performed a colour vision test (Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test) in 19 patients with Parkinson's disease before and after the oral application of the morning dose of L-Dopa. 
The morphological structures responsible for these colour vision disturbances are unknown, but it can be concluded that the dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease is not restricted to the basal ganglia but may involve the visual system as well. 
 We studied the effect of entacapone, a selective catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, on the bioavailability and clinical effect of levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Brain tissue from normal individuals with incidental Lewy bodies and cell loss in pigmented substantia nigra neurons (asymptomatic Parkinson's disease) and age-matched control subjects without nigral Lewy bodies was examined biochemically. 
Rotenone-sensitive NADH coenzyme Q1 reductase activity (complex I) was reduced to levels intermediate between those in control subjects and those in patients with overt Parkinson's disease, but this change did not reach statistical significance. 
There may be some impairment of mitochondrial complex I activity in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The high-resolution solid-state 13C-NMR spectrum of a neuromelanin specimen (from patients dying from nonneurological diseases) is compared with that obtained from enzymatically prepared dopamine-melanin. 
These observations support the view that neuromelanin acts as a strong chelating (and insolubilizing) system for iron ions and further suggest that the attack to this compact composite substrate may be an important step to allow the release of iron ions responsible for the increased lipid peroxidation reported in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 The association of free radicals and particularly free iron in the pathogenesis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and MPTP-induced parkinsonism remains controversial. 
 Forty-one patients with Parkinson's disease and severe dyskinesias were analyzed retrospectively to determine if some general principles would emerge to aid physicians handling this complication of treatment. 
 Three hundred and seventy-six subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease participated in a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled study of the dopamine agonist pergolide mesylate as an adjunct to Sinemet. 
Whether these findings have any implication for the therapeutic response to L-dopa in Parkinson's disease remains to be determined. 
 The paper reports the results of fetal substantia nigra transplantations into the brain of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, performed in different neurosurgical centers in the world. 
However it should be borne in mind that both methods are yet only the experimental approach in Parkinson's disease therapy. 
These results suggest that the clinical trial of NMDA antagonists in patients with Parkinson's disease should be performed. 
Further evidence obtained in animal models of Parkinson's disease indicates that both competitive NMDA antagonists and AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate) antagonists show symptomatic anti-parkinsonian activity in combination with L-DOPA. 
Glutamate antagonists may therefore retard the progression and improve the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease. 
Clinical trials are needed to test the efficacy of the 1-amino-adamantanes with respect to the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 Like idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is characterized, inter alia, by a pronounced non-overlapping loss of dopamine (DA) in caudate, putamen and substantia nigra. 
The metabolic bioactivation may be a general pathway to produce neurotoxins as the pathogenic agents of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurological disease characterized by profound and incapacitating movement disorders. 
Thus, NT-4/5 could be a physiological survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons and may be useful as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease. 
 We determined the number of immunocytochemically identified oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the human hypothalamus of six Parkinson's disease (PD) patients ranging from 59 to 83 years of age. 
 The pharmacological inhibition of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission has evolved to be a major topic in neuropharmacology since enhanced synaptic action of glutamate and possibly other related neurotransmitters has been suggested to play a role both in acute neurological conditions such as ischemia and epilepsy and in chronic degenerative neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
 Research on Parkinson's disease has led to new hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and to the development of neuroprotective agents. 
Recent findings of impaired mitochondrial function, altered iron metabolism and increased lipid peroxidation in the substantia nigra of parkinsonian patients emphasize the significance of oxidative stress and free radical formation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Monotherapy with the dopamine agonist lisuride in the early stages of Parkinson's disease delays the need for the initiation of levodopa treatment to a similar extent as has been reported for L-deprenyl. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons resulting in the major symptoms of akinesia and rigidity. 
Nevertheless, it is recognized that neuromelanin disappearance parallels the loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease, suggesting its participation in nigral cell death. 
Thus, the identification of ionic iron in dopamine neurons of Parkinson's disease zona compacta and its association with neuromelanin has conferred a cytotoxic property to neuromelanin. 
This may explain the reported vulnerability of substantia nigra dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Catalepsy--a state of postural immobility (akinesia) with muscular rigidity (rigor)--and reduced locomotion in animals are behavioral deficits showing similarities with symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The clinical manifestations of drug-induced parkinsonism are often indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Monoamine oxidase type B is an active form in brain, and its preferential substrate is dopamine that is the most constantly reduced monoamine in Parkinson's disease brain. 
 Recent studies have suggested that free radicals play a key role in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These findings clearly indicate that bromocriptine has neuroprotective effects against neurotoxins such as 6-OHDA, probably due in part to its free redical scavenging activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  L-Dopa pioneered the symptomatic therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Mortality due to Parkinson's disease has decreased significantly after the introduction of L-dopa treatment. 
The development of D1-selective dopamine agonists and the introduction of neuroprotective rather than symptomatic therapy are required for treating Parkinson's disease. 
In clinical trials in advanced cancer, in addition to the anticancer activity it was observed that patients suffering from both cancer and Parkinson's disease exhibited marked improvement in parkinsonian symtomatology when treated with antineoplaston A5. 
 Parkinson's disease, a classic human degenerative disease, is one of the commonest neurological disorders. 
Several animal models of Parkinson's disease have been introduced to study mechanisms of selective degeneration of the substantia nigra and to assess effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches. 
Neural transplantation of catecholamine-producing cells seems to be a new promising tool for treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Attempts for transplantation treatment retreated to the laboratories and researchers are currently seeking to select the best king of cells capable of producing dopamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Some treatments used for Parkinson's disease attenuate locomotor depression in rats treated with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. 
Hence, the clinical observation that coadministration of L-dopa with either memantine or amantadine results in enhancement of their action is also reflected in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
These results support the hypothesis that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists facilitate dopamine D2 but not dopamine D1 motor responding in the reserpine-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease. 
In patients with motor symptoms not related to Parkinson's disease (dystonia, dyskinesia and essential tremor) (n = 4). 
In 14 of the patients with Parkinson's disease, the symptoms were evaluated using conventional scales (UPDS, NYPDS, NWPDS, Schwab and England, and Hoehn and Yahr scale). 
Differences in neurotransmitter or metabolites levels between Parkinson's disease and control groups were determined through an independent Student's t test. 
(1) There were significant differences between the levels of BP and GT in patients with Parkinson's disease and control groups, (2) lower GTA levels correlated with more severe rigidity and akinesia, and with the best response to the administration of L-dopa and may be an important marker for prognosis, and (3) lower levels of GT correlated with least akinesia, but not with tremor, which may indicate that the akinesia depends on other biochemical abnormalities besides dopamine depletion. 
Likewise, the incidence of Parkinson's disease is higher in males than in females. 
 In the absence of identification of either an endogenously or an exogenously derived dopaminergic neurotoxin, the most valid hypothesis currently envisaged for etiopathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is selective oxidative stress (OS) in substantia nigra (SN). 
Compared to Parkinson's disease, the densities of more neurotransmitter receptors were altered in PSP. 
 The survival of ventral mesencephalic substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons, which degenerate in Parkinson's disease, is enhanced by glial cells in vitro. 
 Oxidative stress, resulting either from excess generation or reduced scavenging of free radicals, has been proposed to play a role in damaging striatal neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Motor response complications eventually appear in most patients with advanced Parkinson's disease being treated with levodopa. 
To the extent that similar alterations contribute to the appearance of motor complications, the successful symptomatic therapy of Parkinson's disease may require continuous dopaminergic stimulation, as well as direct pharmacologic targeting of striatal dopaminoceptive systems.

This article reviews recent developments in the biology of neurotrophic growth factors, especially members of the nerve growth factor-related neurotrophin family, which may point to their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease, characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, is one of the most well-characterized neurodegenerative disorders from both an anatomical and biochemical standpoint, but as yet the etiology of this disease remains poorly understood. 
Epidemiological, neurochemical, and pathological studies have provided a wealth of data that have spawned many theories of the underlying cause of Parkinson's disease, including environmental and genetic origins. 
Future elucidation of the disease process in Parkinson's disease may yield obvious therapeutic strategies, but even in the absence of such knowledge there are several general approaches that can be taken as strategies for the treatment of a "focal" neurodegenerative disease. 
These include: (a) mimetics, activation of the postsynaptic target(s) of the missing neurons through mimetics of the missing neurotransmitter, e.g., use of a dopamine precursor or dopamine receptor agonist in Parkinson's disease; (b) transplants, replenishment of the missing neurons via transplantation of neurons or nonneuronal cells secreting the appropriate neurotransmitter, e.g., fetal nigral grafts in Parkinson's disease; (c) neurotrophic factors or neuroprotectants, intervention with neurotrophic factors/neuroprotective agents which slow, halt, or reverse the progression of neuronal degeneration, e.g., a dopamine neurotrophic factor in Parkinson's disease. 
The scope of the present article is limited to a review of recent progress in the biology of neurotrophic factors that relates to their potential clinical use in treating the loss of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease.

 In the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease, controversy exists concerning the use of apomorphine- or D-amphetamine-induced rotations as reliable indicators of nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. 
We therefore conclude that maximal lesions of the striatum and substantia nigra are required to generate rotations demonstrable with low dose apomorphine but not with D-amphetamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  To evaluate the pathogenesis of end-of-dose dystonia in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease, we discontinued a steady-state optimal-dose levodopa infusion either abruptly or slowly. 
Competition between dopamine synthesis and L-DOPA egress from striatum must favor L-DOPA egress if decarboxylation declines relatively more than transport in Parkinson's disease.

 The motor effects of selective D-1 dopamine receptor stimulation in Parkinson's disease have been explored in a limited number of studies with partial D-1 agonists only and the results were unsatisfactory. 
These preliminary results do not support the hypothesis that preferential D-1 receptor stimulation facilitates dyskinesia in primates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Met-enkephalin (Met-enk) and substance P (SP) were measured by a combined high-performance liquid chromatography/radioimmunoanalysis method in medial (GPM) and lateral globus pallidus (GPL) from controls and from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 The present study assessed 5-HT3 receptor recognition site levels in homogenates of putamen derived from patients with clinically and neurochemically diagnosed Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease and those from age-, sex- and post-mortem delay-matched neurologically and psychiatrically normal patients to investigate the cellular location of 5-HT3 receptors in the human putamen.

Moreover, the possible protective effects of GM1 were assessed following exposure of cultured cerebellar granule cells and dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons to different doses of 6-OH-DOPA, a metabolite of the dopamine pathway which has excitotoxic properties and has been hypothesized to participate in the pathology of Parkinson's disease. 
The initial studies of neural transplantation have focused on Parkinson's disease, primarily as a model for a more general strategy of "repair by cellular replacement." Parkinson's is known to result from the loss of a small population of cells that produce the essential neuromodulator, dopamine, for much of the brain. 
If transplantation of brain cells can be accomplished successfully in humans, as it has been in animals, then replacement of a small population of dopamine-producing cells in Parkinson's disease should have important functional effects and possibly reverse the course and symptoms of the disease. 
Just as Parkinson's disease is a model clinical condition for testing cellular replacements, fetal neural tissue transplants are also a first step for a broader strategy of molecular and cellular therapies. 
This technique was applied to the collection and preservation of human tissue, and preliminary successful results have been obtained in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Thus GM1 may provide a fruitful treatment strategy for disorders of dopamine function such as Parkinson's disease.

 Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to the goldfish causes a reversible, Parkinson's disease-like syndrome which includes loss of noradrenaline and dopamine from the brain, accumulation of the toxic metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium species (MPP+), and substantial reduction in movement. 
Equivalent observations regarding l-deprenyl and clorgyline have been made in primate models of MPTP toxicity, and l-deprenyl is used for treatment of Parkinson's disease in humans. 
Therefore it is suggested that the evolutionarily equivalent subcortical circuitry and neural density of the goldfish brain may provide a useful model upon which to search for drugs relevant to human Parkinson's disease. 
It appears likely that the nigrostriatal toxicity of MPTP leading to Parkinson's disease-like syndrome may in part be mediated via these reactive oxygen species.

The advent of peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist drugs, which counteract the unwanted effects of apomorphine, and the development of new drug delivery systems including insulin pens and ambulatory mini pumps have led to the resurrection of apomorphine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Over the last five years in Europe, the drug has proved to be a major advance in the treatment of refractory "on-off" oscillations in Parkinson's disease. 
The drug has also proved useful in the clinical pharmacological investigation of the pathophysiology of the motor response to dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson's disease and the occurrence of involuntary movement sequences. 
Neuropsychiatric side-effects are relatively infrequent when compared with ergolene dopamine agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The authors investigated the concentrations of multiple neurochemicals (6 kinds of catecholaminergic and 5 kinds of indolaminergic substances) in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with and without senile dementia (13 Alzheimer type (AD), 7 vascular type (VD), 11 Parkinson's disease (PD) and 9 non-demented controls (C)) by means of a neurochemical analyzing system (Neurochem, ESA). 
 Single photon emission tomography (SPET) with the novel ligand [123I]-IBZM was used to image central dopamine D2 receptors in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
 Autonomic dysfunction is responsible for much of the morbidity associated with frequently encountered neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral neuropathies, as well as with the rarer primary autonomic nervous system degenerations. 
Copper deficiency in second generation rats produces low dopamine levels in the corpus striatum and results in clinical signs analogous to those of Parkinson's disease. 
 The dopaminergic system implicated in human disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and prolactinomas, exerts its effects through several dopamine receptors. 
 Depression is a major clinical feature of Parkinson's disease. 
We report the increased amount of motor disability in four patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease after exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine. 
The possibility of a clinically relevant dopamine-antagonistic capacity of fluoxetine in Parkinson's disease patients must be considered. 
Our results obtained in the experimental model of Parkinson's disease provide evidence that the damage of the central dopaminergic pathways induces alterations of some immune functions in mice. 
A reduction of postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors in de novo parkinsonian patients makes the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease rather unlikely. 
Normal IBZM binding does not prove the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease; however, together with a positive apomorphine test, it strongly supports the clinical diagnosis. 
N-Methylation and oxidation of isoquinolines or other endogenous compounds may be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 The identification of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as dopaminergic neurotoxins that can induce parkinsonism in humans and animals has contributed to a better understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Interaction between iron and melanin may provide a reasonable explanation for the vulnerability of the melanin containing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In the absence of an identified exogenous or endogenous neurotoxin in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, iron-melanin interaction in the SN may serve as a candidate for the oxygen-radical induced neurodegeneration of the melanin containing dopaminergic neurons. 
These selective inhibitors are demonstrating unique pharmacology and initial controlled clinical studies are providing evidence to support their action as anti-depressants and anti-Parkinson's disease drugs and possibly as neuroprotectors. 
 The "wearing-off" phenomenon is a clinically recognized adverse effect of long-term L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
We suggest that these changes after long-term L-DOPA administration are causes of the "wearing-off" phenomenon in Parkinson's disease. 
Accumulating information supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress involving lipid peroxidation may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
The objectives of this review are, first, to discuss some of the roles of active oxygen species in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease; second, to examine the possible effects of antioxidants as the protective therapy for Parkinson's disease, and, third, to summarize results from in vitro experiments that the dopamine agonist bromocriptine, used for treatment of Parkinson's disease, has a strong antioxidative effect. 
 The biochemical process underlying Parkinson's disease is dopamine cell death of the nigrostriatal system. 
The involvement of monoamine oxidase is discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 The advance of Parkinson's disease has been suspected to be an outcome of oxidative stresses related to the metabolism of dopamine. 
Several recent studies have tested whether deprenyl (selegiline) or alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) might attenuate the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
Methods developed in the deprenyl trials and newly discovered CSF markers of Parkinson's disease may be useful tools for future investigations of neuroprotective strategies against Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that estrogen may have a protective effect against methamphetamine-induced dopamine depletions and may relate to the fact that males are more likely to incur Parkinson's disease than females. 
Due to clinical studies especially MAO-B-inhibitors appear to slow the progression of neurological deficits in Parkinson's disease and the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. 
100), the parkinsonian features were similar to those of Parkinson's disease, including a resting tremor in 6 cases. 
The parkinsonian syndrome was initially the sole manifestation in 7 patients, who were diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. 
His parents and a brother suffered from Parkinson's disease and juvenile parkinsonism, respectively, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance. 
While in the hospital, his mental functions deteriorated to the state of dementia and orthostatic hypotension became apparent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The mechanisms underlying dopamine cell death in substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease remain unknown. 
Indeed, in postmortem tissues from patients dying with Parkinson's disease there is evidence for inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, altered iron metabolism and decreased levels of reduced glutathione. 
However, alterations in iron levels in substantia nigra are not specific to Parkinson's disease but also occur in other basal ganglia degenerative diseases. 
This is further suggested by a failure to find any alterations in iron metabolism in cases of incidental Lewy body disease (presymptomatic Parkinson's disease). 
However, there is a reduction in the levels of reduced glutathione in substantia nigra in incidental Lewy body disease of the same magnitude as occurs in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
This would suggest that alterations in glutathione function are an early marker of pathology in Parkinson's disease and may be a clue to the primary cause of nigral cell death. 
 The findings three decades ago that the symptoms of Parkinson's disease were related to a deficiency of striatal dopamine and that they were reversible by the administration of levodopa heralded a new era of investigative interest in this disorder. 
Since then, there has been steady progress towards a better understanding of the nature of Parkinson's disease. 
This presentation critically reviews these various aspects of Parkinson's disease. 
 Neurogenic bladder frequently occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine and 2-phenylethylamine levels in striatal tissue are known to be increased after administration of selegiline (L-deprenyl), but it is still difficult to explain why this treatment induces longevity or dopaminergic neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease. 
This could have significance for the action of selegiline in Parkinson's disease, as overactive corticostriatal glutaminergic function has been implicated in the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and polyamines are potent modulators of the excitotoxic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-glutamate subtype receptor. 
 Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) does not occur evenly throughout the nucleus: the ventrolateral part of the substantia nigra degenerates more severely, whereas the medial part is relatively preserved. 
Postmortem studies show increased iron, decreased glutathione, and increased lipid peroxidation in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Initial studies demonstrate that the MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl (selegiline) delays the development of disability in otherwise untreated patients with early Parkinson's disease. 
 In Parkinson's disease (PD) an elevation of iron with staging of the disease has been observed in the substantia nigra (SN), especially the zona compacta (ZC). 
 Presymptomatic detection of Parkinson's disease is necessary if neuroprotective therapies are to be utilized in its treatment. 
Post-mortem studies of brain in Parkinson's disease may provide clues to biochemical markers indicative of nigral pathology. 
Mitochondrial complex I activity is reduced in substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease and it was reported also to be markedly reduced in blood platelets. 
However, subsequent studies suggest that the difference in platelet complex I activity is too small to be diagnostic of Parkinson's disease. 
There are also selective reductions in brain glutathione levels in Parkinson's disease restricted to substantia nigra, which do not occur in other neurodegenerative disorders and are not due to drug treatment. 
Importantly, in incidental Lewy body disease (preclinical Parkinson's disease) nigral glutathione levels are reduced to the same degree as in advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease is a specific disorder of central dopaminergic systems. 
 [3H] Dopamine (DA) uptake by platelet storage granules was determined in 10 never-treated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (in 6 of them, also after 6 months of levodopa treatment), in 18 long-term levodopa-treated patients and in 15 age-matched normal controls. 
 Since 25 years ago, it was postulated that the antiparkinsonian activity of L-DOPA was due to the activation of the synthesis and the release of dopamine that it could trigger in the dopaminergic terminals preserved during the Parkinson's disease. 
 Serotonergic (5-HT) and dopaminergic activities have been examined in Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and compared with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Here, we report on the regional kinetic uptake of [123I]beta-CIT in the brain of 4 normal volunteers and 2 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In 2 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease striatal activity was markedly decreased while the activity in hypothalamus-midbrain areas was only mildly diminished. 
Uptake into cortical and cerebellar areas appeared to be unchanged in Parkinson's disease. 
Consequently, in Parkinson's disease the striatal to cerebellar ratio was decreased to values around 2.5 after 20 hours. 
 Schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease have been considered inversely related neuropsychiatric disorders since the former has been attributed to increased dopaminergic transmission while the latter is thought to result from loss of dopaminergic neurons. 
The same clinical condition can be triggered by rapid discontinuation of dopaminergic medication in Parkinson's disease. 
Further, neuroleptic malignant syndrome shares key clinical features such as extrapyramidal motor disturbances and hyperthermia with a severe form of clinical deterioration in Parkinson's disease patients, the akinetic Parkinsonian crisis. 
 The blink reflex abnormalities present in the 6 hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of parkinsonism mimicked those of the human with Parkinson's disease. 
 Over recent years I have been studying whether dopamine agonist treatment alone, or in early combination with levodopa, might institute a better long-term treatment in Parkinson's disease than levodopa alone. 
Indeed, early combination of levodopa with bromocriptine, pergolide or lisuride has indicated that this kind of treatment results in better management of Parkinson's disease with fewer fluctuations in disability, especially end-of-dose disturbances and dyskinesias, than treatment with levodopa alone. 
Thus, it appears advisable to initiate the dopaminergic treatment in early Parkinson's disease by using a combination of selegiline, levodopa and a dopamine agonist. 
 Oral levodopa treatment remains the most efficacious treatment of Parkinson's disease, but the majority of patients treated with a levodopa monotherapy for more than 5 years will develop fluctuations and/or dyskinesias. 
 The last decades have been characterized by impressive research activity in connection with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Amantadine was introduced for the pharmacological management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) because of its beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease which were attributed to dopaminomimetic properties. 
Amantadine has psychotomimetic properties in patients with Parkinson's disease and normal controls. 
The clinical evidence includes alterations in depressive symptoms with aging (concomitant with possible changes in dopamine metabolism), potential dopaminergic involvement in several subtypes of depression, similarities between some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and those of depression (including psychomotor retardation and diminished motivation), and potential dopaminergic abnormalities in seasonal mood disorder. 
The pronounced synergism between dopaminergic agents and glutamate receptor antagonists may provide a means of using very low doses of the two drug classes in concert to treat Parkinson's disease effectively and minimize dose-related drug side effects. 
These data suggest the functional derangement of a distinct corticofugal loops in schizophrenia and in certain aspects of Parkinson's disease. 
 We correlated monoamine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid from de novo (untreated) patients with Parkinson's disease with their clinical symptoms and therapeutic outcome after two years of L-dopa with/without other anti-parkinson medication. 
The role of iron in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, brain injury due to exogenous causes, neuroleptic-induced movement disorders, schizophrenia, and other neuropsychiatric disorders is currently being explored. 
This study using hemiparkinsonian monkeys does not support the suggestion that a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist such as MK-801 would be useful in adjunctive therapy of human Parkinson's disease. 
 The discovery of a selective striatal dopamine deficiency in Parkinson's disease has led to dopamine replacement therapies including L-DOPA, dopamine full and partial agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors. 
Recent studies emphasize the significance of oxidative stress and free radical formation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
 We summarized here two distinctively interesting observations made in the DA neuronal circuitry implicated in Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that N-methylated and oxidized derivatives of dopamine-derived alkaloids may be potent dopaminergic neurotoxins similar to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion in the human brain and may induce Parkinson's disease after long years of accumulation. 
 Urinary bladder disorders often occur, sometimes very early, during the course of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings and data from the literature suggest that in Parkinson's disease detrusor hyperreflexia is the consequence of dopamine nigrostriatal depletion. 
Grafts of chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or fetal ventral mesencephalic neurons bring behavioral improvement in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active metabolite of 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is taken up into dopaminergic terminals and selectively destroys dopaminergic neurons, serving as a valuable tool in animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
These results show that the convulsant qualities of MK 801 and SKF 38393, that have been detected in animal models of Parkinson's disease, can be reproduced in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. 
An appropriate mixture of a glutamate antagonist and a D1 agonist could theoretically be used beneficially in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, without causing epilepsy as a side effect. 
 A course of treatments with electroconvulsive shock (ECS) has been reported to reestablish L-dopa efficacy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
We wished to determine if ECS could modify L-dopa and dopamine metabolism in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
In this work 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylglycol (MHPG), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were quantified in normal CSF and in patients with untreated Parkinson's disease (PD) and olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA). 
This MPTP-induced model of striatal dopamine deficiency in primates presents similarities with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and may be used to evaluate the effects of dopaminergic lesions and transplants on brain function. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized mainly by a loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway. 
Recent basic and clinical investigations have led to the development of new therapeutical strategies for Parkinson's disease. 
 The gene encoding the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) is located on human chromosome 11q23 and has been circumstantially associated with a number of human disorders including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and susceptibility to alcoholism. 
Although proof that oxidant stress actually causes the loss of monoaminergic neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease is lacking, there is a considerable body of evidence from studies in both animals and humans that support the concept. 
(2) The substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease reveals evidence of oxidant stress by the findings of increased lipid peroxidation and decreased reduced glutathione. 
(3) Total iron is increased and ferritin is reduced in the substantia nigra pars compacta in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
(5) Antioxidant defense mechanisms appear to be reduced in the parkinsonian substantia nigra with the findings of decreased activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Effects of the long term, continuous administration of a dopamine agonist on motor response complications attending levodopa therapy were studied in 7 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease under controlled conditions. 
 Using positron emission tomography (PET) we previously showed that activation of the putamen, supplementary motor area, and cingulate cortex is impaired in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they are off treatment and perform volitional motor tasks. 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease have received intracerebral transplants of autologous adrenal medulla in the attempt to counteract their severe motor dysfunctions. 
 Eight patients with Parkinson's disease performed simple reaction time (SRT), uncued, partially and fully cued four choice (CRT) tasks. 
 Two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease were followed for 6 months before, and 18 months after, receiving stereotaxic grafts of fetal mesencephalic tissue from aborted human fetuses. 
In comparisons of the operated and the unoperated sides, fluoro-dopa showed increased uptake in the caudate nucleus of patient 1 at 6 months and at 13 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis and clinical expression of Parkinson's disease. 
 PIP: Researchers believe fetal tissue can be easily transplanted into and cure people with incurable debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
DOI: 10.1056/NEJM199211263272211 PMID: 1435888 [Indexed for MEDLINE]  BACKGROUND: Intracerebral transplantation of fetal dopaminergic neurons is a promising new approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The results in these patients resemble those obtained in MPTP-treated primates and suggest that this will be a useful model for the assessment of transplantation therapies in Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Patients with Parkinson's disease tend to have a reduced response to levodopa after 5 to 20 years of therapy, with "on-off" fluctuations consisting of dyskinesia alternating with immobility. 
In an effort to modify the motor disability of advanced Parkinson's disease, we implanted embryonic mesencephalic tissue containing dopamine cells into the caudate and putamen of seven patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal-tissue implants appear to offer long-term clinical benefit to some patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
 BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons that innervate the caudate and the putamen. 
This report compares the clinical results in four case patients with severe Parkinson's disease who underwent stereotaxic implantation of human fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue in one caudate nucleus with the results in a control group of similar subjects assigned at random to a one-year delay in surgery. 
 The source and site of the DOPA decarboxylation to dopamine in Parkinson's disease (PD) and animal models of PD are controversial. 
 Owing to a lack of knowledge of the pathophysiology and pathochemistry of Parkinson's disease, conservative treatment was long restricted to the treatment of symptoms. 
The recently discovered NMDA antagonism, also in conjunction with a description of the mechanism of action of amantadine, which makes it possible to inhibit the effect of excitatory amino acids--in particular glutamate--in the CNS, led to the principle of neuro-protection, which is now considered the key to the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The present study examined the striata of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and age-matched controls for regional differences in the DA transporter and binding to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. 
 We used two analytic methods (a multichannel coulometric electrode array with high-performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry) to measure CSF dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in mildly affected, unmedicated subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
These data and the utility of the motor tasks are discussed in reference to a laboratory model of Parkinson's disease. 
Low micromolar concentrations of memantine, levels known to be tolerated by patients receiving the drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, prevent NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity in cultures of rat cortical and retinal ganglion cell neurons; memantine also appears to be both safe and effective in a rat stroke model. 
We also discuss the possibility of treatment by 6R-BH4 of neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression and infantile autism. 
It is concluded that, by antagonizing NMDA receptor-mediated ACh release, memantine and amantadine may act as functional "anticholinergics" when administered clinically to treat Parkinson's disease. 
 CGS 15873 is a relatively specific dopamine agonist with preferential activity at the presynaptic autoreceptor and therefore may represent a novel agent for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or Parkinson's disease. 
 Ferrous ion is an essential cofactor in dopamine synthesis and its decrease may reduce the dopamine production in the nigrostriatal system, the basis of pathogenetic mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The serum iron, ferritin, total-iron-binding-capacity (TIBC) levels and transferrin saturation were analysed in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease and 30 controls. 
 After 9 years of treatment for Parkinson's disease, a 68-year-old woman developed the complications of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) while she was still receiving levodopa, bromocriptine and amantadine hydrochloride. 
It may be supposed that synaptosomal uptake of low affinity serotonin is most perceptible to the effect of MPTP and is of a particular importance in the development of Parkinson's disease symptoms. 
We have also studied the intramembrane A2-D2 receptor interaction in an experimental model of Parkinson's disease, namely in rats with a unilateral 6-OH-dopamine-induced lesion of the nigro-striatal dopamine pathway. 
This mechanism of burst generation in mammalian neurons may be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
The D1-selective agonist, CY 208-243, generated a dose-dependent locomotor response in this animal model for Parkinson's disease; low doses elicited little or no effect while higher doses resulted in a short burst of locomotor activity (2 h). 
 The major symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are due to degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and depletion of dopamine (DA). 
 The author reviews the various strategies for treatment of Parkinson's disease by modern drugs. 
Either levodopa or a levodopa agonist is recommended for treatment of early Parkinson's disease. 
 Over the past 3 years, there has been great interest in transplantation therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The ethical controversy, need for long-term immunosuppression, and difficulty with obtaining tissue of the appropriate age and delivering the appropriate quantity to the putamen have made this technique less than adequate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Two experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis, based on anatomical evidence, that contrast gain might be reduced in the retinal periphery in Parkinson's disease. 
These results suggest that contrast gain may be lowered in the peripheral retina in Parkinson's disease, perhaps because of an abnormality of dopamine amacrine cells, whose density peaks in the peripheral retina. 
 The mechanisms by which adrenal medulla grafts influence the function of host brains in animal models of Parkinson's disease are unclear. 
 An alteration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system is believed to be the main pathogenetic factor of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Clinically, the combination of the D2 agonist bromocriptine with L-dopa (which has pronounced D1 effects) is a highly effective treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 Vesicosphincteric disorders are frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease, due to a lesion of the locus niger of the extrapyramidal tract which no longer secretes sufficient dopamine to activate the nigrostriatal tract. 
50% of patients with Parkinson's disease present with disturbances of micturition and these symptoms may be presenting complaint of the disease in 10% of cases. 
Dopamine receptors are the targets for drugs used to treat neurological dysfunctions such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, and thus knowledge of their specific cellular location is important for devising future therapeutic manipulations. 
 Parkinson's disease has been modeled in humans, lower primates, and to a lesser extent in some other vertebrates by administration of the potent neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine). 
The MPTP model has thus drawn considerable attention as a system to search for anti-Parkinson's disease drugs, although the cost and scarcity of primates has limited extensive applications. 
We interpret these and other data to indicate that MPTP can induce a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in the goldfish that is similar in many aspects to the syndrome induced by MPTP in humans and other primates. 
This remarkable parallel may permit the goldfish to supplement expensive and scarce primates for the purpose of searching and screening neuroprotective drugs with specific relevance to Parkinson's disease. 
 We measured metabolites of tyrosine and tryptophan (TRP) in the frontal cortex, putamen (PT), and pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SN) of control and Parkinson's disease (PD) brain tissues. 
 Using energy-dispersive x-ray analysis on an electron microscope working in the scanning transmission electron microscopy mode equipped with a microanalysis system, we studied the subcellular distribution of trace elements in neuromelanin-containing neurons of the substantia nigra zona compacta (SNZC) of three cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) [one with Alzheimer's disease (AD)] and of three controls, in Lewy bodies of SNZC, and in synthetic dopamine-melanin chemically charged or uncharged with Fe. 
These findings coincide with the results studied in Parkinson's disease, although these subjects were not diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. 
This may account for the present finding that aged people have neurophysiological abnormalities in CNS which are similar to those in Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, using quantitative in vitro autoradiography, we demonstrate decreased angiotensin receptor binding in the substantia nigra and striatum of postmortem brains from patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Implantation of the cultured human and rat mesencephalic tissue into a 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's disease produced marked recovery from amphetamine induced rotational asymmetry in the recipient rats, but no such recovery was observed following implantation of cortical cultures. 
In a relatively young patient who may be treated for many years, a dopamine receptor agonist can be initiated without LD therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Application of external weak magnetic fields recently has been reported to be efficacious in the treatment of a 62-year-old patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) complicated by levodopa-induced fluctuations in motor response ("on-off"). 
 The clinical management of Parkinson's disease has been revolutionized by the introduction of levodopa therapy. 
It has significantly reduced disability and has extended life expectancies of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, we investigated the effect of protein-restricted diet on fluctuations in eight patients with Parkinson's disease who had been receiving long-term levodopa treatment (mean 12.5 years). 
We concluded that protein-restricted diet during the daytime offers a fascinating technique for the control of motor response fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease undergoing long-term levodopa treatment. 
infusions to 7 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in primate models of Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to an overactivity of excitatory glutamatergic projections from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia resulting in rigidity and akinesia. 
D1/D2 receptor cooperation in the induction of LTD may play a crucial role in the behavioural function of DA and in the therapeutic effects of DA agonists in Parkinson's disease. 
 In a modified MPTP model of Parkinson's disease in the marmoset, both L-DOPA and the dopamine D2 agonist quinpirole were found to exhibit anti-bradykinetic activity. 
 Studies of reaction time in Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested a selective deficit in simple reaction time (SRT), compared with choice reaction time (CRT). 
 A newly developed liquid chromatographic system with a multiple electrode detector was used for quantification of neurochemical substances in ventricular fluid of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Essential tremor (ET), more common than Parkinson's disease (PD), has commonly been considered "benign." This investigation compared diagnostic characteristics, patient satisfaction with treatment, and psychosocial complications between a group of male patients treated for essential tremor and a group of male parkinsonian patients. 
 Cardiovascular reflexes were evaluated in 18 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who had a Hoehn & Yahr score of III-IV. 
Amantadine was introduced for the pharmacological management of NMS because of its beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease which were attributed to direct or indirect dopaminomimetic properties of amantadine. 
Resting energy expenditure was measured, by indirect calorimetry, in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease and in eight healthy age-matched control subjects. 
In the patients with Parkinson's disease measurements were made in both the untreated state and after an injection of the dopamine agonist apomorphine (treated state). 
Resting energy expenditure was higher in patients with Parkinson's disease in both the treated and untreated states than in the control subjects. 
Of the patients with Parkinson's disease, seven showed no difference in resting energy expenditure between the two treatment states, whereas four showed markedly increased resting energy expenditure in the untreated state. 
In Parkinson's disease, even in optimally treated patients, resting energy expenditure is raised and this may contribute to the weight loss seen in this disease. 
In vitro stimulation of astrocytes therefore triggers the expression of currently uncharacterized factors which influence the biochemical differentiation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, the cells that degenerate in Parkinson's disease. 
The reduction in OB norepinephrine concentration in the MPTP-treated animals may be related to the olfactory deficits which accompany Parkinson's disease. 
 Selegiline (deprenyl) is a selective, irreversible cerebral monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor (MAO-B) that is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
There is also evidence to suggest that selegiline may delay the need for levodopa therapy by up to 11 months in patients with early Parkinson's disease, although the relative contribution of neuroprotective and symptomatic effects of selegiline in these patients has yet to be clarified. 
Further, if a simple and inexpensive method is developed to identify preclinical Parkinson's disease before nigrostriatal damage is advanced, selegiline may be useful in a broader patient population with possible financial benefits to society through reduction of the considerable indirect costs of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings indicate that MK-801 should not be advocated as an adjunct to dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopaminergic denervation supersensitivity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesias, the most common and limiting side effect in the drug treatment of Parkinson's disease, yet the mechanisms that mediate altered drug sensitivity remain poorly understood. 
These results add further impetus to exploring the therapeutic potential of BDNF in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Iron, a transition metal possibly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, was tested for its toxic effects toward cultures of dissociated rat mesencephalic cells. 
 Smokers are less likely to develop Parkinson's disease (PD) than is true of non-smokers, and PD is the only disease inversely related to smoking. 
 The local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) at steady state and after the intravenous administration of levodopa (1 mg/kg) was measured by the xenon-enhanced computed tomographic method in six patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and in nine patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The baseline LCBF values in most brain regions in patients with PSP were lower than those in patients with Parkinson's disease, and hyperfrontality of the LCBF was lost. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, the injection of levodopa markedly increased LCBF, especially in the striatum, thalamus, and internal capsule (approximately 40%). 
The LCBF increases after the administration of levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease may be secondary to metabolic activation of the dopaminergic system. 
The different LCBF responses to levodopa between patients with PSP and those with Parkinson's disease may reflect differences in pathologic features, such as in the degree of preservation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the distribution and density of dopamine receptors, and are also related to the clinical effectiveness of levodopa therapy. 
 It has been suggested that not only mesostriatal but also mesolimbic pathways are involved in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
Using quantitative ligand autoradiography we have investigated dopamine transporter sites in basal ganglia of patients affected by Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
Both Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy populations were characterized by a marked loss of [3H]mazindol binding sites in the neostriatum (about 75%) and in the nucleus accumbens (about 65%). 
These results suggest that in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy severe decreases of dopamine uptake sites occur not only in the mesostriatal pathway but also in the mesolimbic tract. 
In Parkinson's disease (PD), L-DOPA therapy, usually in combination with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, is common. 
Neural transplants to the striatum of PD were first applied using autografts of the adrenal medulla in 1985, but resulted in transient or only slight improvements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Pergolide mesylate ((8 beta)-8-[(methylthio)methyl]-6-propylergoline monomethanesulfonate, LY 127809, CAS 66104-23-2) is a novel and potent dopamine agonist marketed for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Results from studies in depression, Parkinson's disease, and animal models of depression suggest a deficiency of dopamine in depression. 
 D2 dopamine receptor may be related with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
Moreover, these findings indicate that the hypothalamus participates in the behavioral effects induced by DA depleting lesions and highlight the importance of hypothalamic pathology in Parkinson's disease. 
Amantadine has been used in Norway to treat Parkinson's disease since 1972. 
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether the recently reported decreased incidence of stroke and atherosclerotic disease in a university hospital-based Parkinson's disease patient population would be demonstrated in our patient population. 
METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control review of the last 119 Parkinson's disease patients discharged from the Middleton Veterans Affairs Hospital Neurology Service to study the incidence of ischemic stroke, myocardial ischemia, tobacco use, and other stroke risk factors. 
Controls were age and sex matched and were randomly taken from 238 non-Parkinson's disease discharges in which stroke or myocardial infarction was not the reason for hospitalization. 
Myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, tobacco use, atrial fibrillation, cancer, and ethanol abuse were significantly more prevalent in the controls, whereas dementia and congestive heart failure were the only variables studied that were more prevalent in the Parkinson's disease patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: Our study failed to demonstrate that Parkinson's disease patients from a Veteran population were protected from ischemic stroke. 
These results do not support the hypothesis that transport of L-dopa into the brain is inhibited by 3OMD to cause the declining response seen in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
 Since the discovery that L-DOPA could alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, it has been assumed that the striatum is the site of action of the dopamine formed from L-DOPA. 
Activation of D1 receptors in the substantia nigra may, in part, explain some of the synergistic effects of D1 and D2 agonists in animal models for Parkinson's disease. 
Clinical studies suggest that these findings may have important implications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Our results reveal novel possibilities for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 MPTP is known as a selective neurotoxin which destroys dopamine-containing neurons, and induces a model of Parkinson's disease. 
 We administered the partial dopamine agonist terguride under controlled conditions to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), both as monotherapy and in conjunction with intravenous levodopa. 
 Dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in striatal homogenates of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated rhesus monkeys and humans with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and compared with the activity in control tissue. 
However, when 120 mM NaCl was included in the assay medium, a significantly higher increase in the Vmax of dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was observed in the caudate of MPTP-parkinsonian rhesus monkeys and the putamen of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
No such sensitization was seen in the MPTP-treated rhesus putamen or human Parkinson's disease caudate tissue. 
Our results point to a region-specific functional sensitization of D1 receptors as a consequence of severe dopaminergic denervation of the striatum and suggest the possibility of a therapeutic potential of a D1 agonist with full intrinsic activity in Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, its potent stimulatory effects in DA-depleted animals suggest a possible use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These results suggest that GM1 ganglioside may hold promise as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC) may be responsible for certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Selegiline has been used in the therapy of Parkinson's disease since 1986. 
The mode of action of this drug in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease is still under discussion. 
 The initial benefits of levodopa decline for as many as half of all patients with Parkinson's disease treated for 2 years or more. 
F-dopa/PET holds particular promise in preclinical screening of individuals at risk for Parkinson's disease on genetic or environmental grounds. 
We believe that with greater availability, these PET techniques and others currently under development will have significant impact on the diagnosis and management of patients with Parkinson's disease and related disorders. 
 The action of toxins or the altered metabolism of dopamine may lead to oxidative stress in substantia nigra, thereby inducing dopamine cell death and the onset of Parkinson's disease. 
Indeed there is a selective impairment of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, mimicking the mode of action of the selective nigral toxin MPTP. 
The increased formation of free radical species in substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease may be accelerated by an accumulation of iron within this brain region. 
Their relevance to Parkinson's disease is currently unknown, and we await reports of potential changes in these sites in this condition. 
In the near future, we may encounter reports of changes in receptor regulation that may help us in understanding the changes that occur in Parkinson's disease. 
 Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is thought to represent a specific clinical-pathologic entity, up to 20% of patients diagnosed as having PD will have another disorder at autopsy. 
 Since Parkinson's disease was first described by James Parkinson in 1817, the natural history has been confounded by various treatment modalities: the replenishment of deficient dopamine, the addition of the dopamine agonists, and the more recent addition of drugs whose putative action may slow the natural history of the disease. 
 Administration of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to mammals causes damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway similar to that observed in Parkinson's disease. 
The similarity between the MPTP model and Parkinson's disease further raises the possibility that oxy-radicals may play a significant role in the etiology of this neurodegenerative disorder. 
 Pergolide mesylate ((8 beta)-8-[(methylthio)methyl]-6-propylergoline monomethanesulfonate, LY 127,809, CAS 66104-23-2) is a novel and potent dopamine agonist marketed for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 New concepts about the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease have emerged. 
The rational for starting treatment with selegiline at this time is discussed in the context of the role that increased MAO-B activity plays in the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopaminergic agonists are drugs that directly stimulate the dopamine receptors of the striatum and have proved useful in treating Parkinson's disease. 
 The chronic effect of L-Dopa administration on the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) was studied in two groups of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD): patients de novo (DN) and patients with on-off fluctuations. 
 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active product of MPTP, caused Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. 
Delays in the visual evoked responses and abnormalities in contrast sensitivity occur in patients with Parkinson's disease.

We studied 35 patients with Parkinson's disease and 26 controls of comparable age and visual acuities using visual evoked responses, color vision, and contrast sensitivity testing. 
The significant error in chromatic discrimination observed in Parkinson's disease patients may be due to altered intraretinal dopaminergic synaptic activity in these patients. 
 The major neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA), resulting in a deficiency of DA, and of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which catalyzes the synthesis of L-dopa. 
 Studies indicate that selegiline, a monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor, slows progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and delays the need for levodopa. 
 A long preclinical or asymptomatic period may occur in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The motor disturbance in Parkinson's disease affects all voluntary movement, including innate rhythmical processes such as gait, breathing, and chewing. 
 The anti-viral drug amantadine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease without the drug having a well established mechanism of action.

The 5 drugs or groups of drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are: (a) anticholinergic drugs; (b) amantadine; (c) levodopa plus a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor; (d) dopamine agonists; and (e) selegiline. 
Thirty-four patients only showed symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and four patients showed, in addition, subtle clinical signs of progressive supranuclear palsy or multisystem atrophy. 
Thus, imaging of dopamine D2 receptors using readily available IBZM-SPECT seems to distinguish between L-dopa-responsive (most likely Parkinson's disease of Lewy body type) and L-dopa-unresponsive parkinsonism in patients not previously treated with dopamimetic drugs. 
 L-DOPA is frequently used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its use in patients with more advanced PD is complicated by on-off phenomena. 
 Genes encoding G-protein-coupled receptors, including dopamine, serotonin, muscarinic cholinergic, and adrenergic receptors, play an important role in neurotransmission and may be involved in the pathophysiology of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease (HD). 
 Evidence exists for a negative correlation between Parkinson's disease and smoking. 
 A study was performed in 220 out-patients with Parkinson's disease followed by general neurologists. 
This finding was consistent with clinical reports of a subset of patients with Parkinson's disease in whom long-term efficacy of pergolide therapy is observed. 
The use of dopamine receptor antagonists in controlling emesis induced by dopamine agonists used in Parkinson's disease poses theoretical problems which can be overcome by using drugs with selectivity for the chemoreceptor trigger zone, such as domperidone or metoclopramide. 
Opiates may act through dopamine receptors or mu-receptors on dopaminergic nerves, but serotonergic mechanisms may also be involved in the action of some opiates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are a common complication of chronic dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
This pattern of age-related changes in MAO B, striatal dopamine and the sensitivity of the nigrostriatal system to toxic insult may provide insights into factors which have been implicated in age-related neurodegeneration and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Glutamic acid and its analogs are excitotoxins that might contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Moreover, these results raise the possibility that perturbations in local neurotrophin synthesis might contribute to dopamine-related disorders including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
These results suggest that dopamine-containing liposomes can partially ameliorate the deficits associated with a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, and demonstrate the potential of this technology as a method for the controlled delivery of therapeutic agents into discrete areas of the brain. 
 To examine the possible causal contribution of normal or accelerated aging to the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease, we measured the influence of aging on subregional striatal dopamine and homovanillic acid levels in postmortem brain of 23 neurologically and psychiatrically normal human subjects 14-92 years old. 
(b) The regional and subregional pattern of striatal dopamine loss in normal aging differs substantially from the pattern typically observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease; therefore, the cause of idiopathic Parkinson's disease cannot be primarily an age-dependent neurodegenerative process. 
These two subdivisions of the enlarged basal ganglia, are provided with different functions; accordingly, limbic DA plays an active role in goal-oriented (motivated) behaviour; instead, extrapyramidal DA is essential for execution of learned motor programs and its impairment results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Using positron emission tomographic scanning we have measured striatal RAC uptake in 6 untreated patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 5 chronically treated patients with PD and a fluctuating response to L-dopa, 10 patients with striatonigral degeneration (SND), and 9 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). 
Patients with SND and PSP show a decrease in striatal RAC binding, but to a lesser extent than patients with PD and a fluctuating response to treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Two patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent implantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue into the putamen were serially studied using positron emission tomography and [18F]6-L-fluorodopa ([18F]dopa). 
 Ventral mesencephalic tissue from aborted human fetuses (age, 6-7 weeks' postconception) was implanted unilaterally into the putamen using stereotaxic surgery in 2 immunosuppressed patients (Patients 3 and 4 in our series) with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The results indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease can show significant and sustained improvement of motor function after intrastriatal implantation of fetal dopamine-rich mesencephalic tissue. 
 Cerebral uptake and utilization of levodopa was measured in eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) by [beta-11C]-L-DOPA and positron emission tomography (PET). 
Similar findings have been recently observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 New methods of drug delivery and slowing down the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the major goals of research. 
The mechanism of its beneficial effect in early and advanced Parkinson's disease is not settled. 
 Abiotrophy is hypothesized to explain the onset and time course of deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) Abiotrophy includes: 1) exposure to agent(s) causing the death of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons (DNSns), 2) gradual death of DNSns with age, 3) summation of 1) and 2) until DNSn numbers fall below a threshold for detectable neurological deficits. 
 Parkinson's disease, or paralysis agitans, is a central nervous system disease. 
Awareness by the PACU nurse of the potential for systemic effects of dopamine is one important element of postanesthesia care for the patient with Parkinson's disease. 
The present results suggest that implantation of DA microspheres may promote DA fiber growth and extended recovery of surviving DA neurons, and, therefore, could be of therapeutic usefulness in Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease glutamate antagonists may counteract central glutamatergic hyperactivity and may be of value as anti-parkinsonian drugs. 
An increase of dopaminergic activity and/or a reduction of glutamatergic activity may contribute to the development of paranoid hallucinatory psychosis in schizophrenic patients and of pharmacotoxic psychosis in Parkinson's disease. 
 The use of the dopamine receptor agonists in Parkinson's disease has a compelling logic. 
 The addition of a D2 agonist such as bromocriptine to L-Dopa therapy can often improve the response of patients with Parkinson's disease dramatically. 
An understanding of these pathways and how dopamine agonists affect them gives insight into some of the clinical problems experienced in treating Parkinson's disease (the "on-off" phenomenon, for example). 
 Levodopa is the most potent symptomatic treatment for Parkinson's disease but adverse reactions are common and the initial response is not maintained. 
Further there is recent evidence that suggests that free radicals generated from the oxidative metabolism of dopamine may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
Altogether, three patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and three normal volunteers were examined, first without nitecapone and then with an oral dose of 100 mg of nitecapone 1 hour before the IV injection of 3 mCi of [18F]6-fluorodopa. 
 For patients with newly-diagnosed Parkinson's disease, current research is pointing to new therapeutic approaches. 
 Several controlled trials have shown that the dopamine agonist, Trivastal (piribedil), is active in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly with regard to tremor. 
To determine its efficacy as monotherapy in patients previously untreated with levodopa, a 3-month multicentre study was conducted with Trivastal 50 mg LP in 113 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The study population consisted of 66 men and 47 women, aged 63.1, SD 0.6 (43-79) years with a 2.1, SD 0.2 (1-15) year history of Parkinson's disease. 
On the Webster scale, tremor fell from 1.7 to 1 (-41%, P less than 0.001), bradykinesia from 1.5 to 0.8 (-47%, P less than 0.001) and rigidity from 1.3 to 0.9 (-31%, P less than 0.001); on the specific scale, rest tremor decreased in daily duration and amplitude from 3.9 to 2.4 (-39%, P less than 0.001) and from 2.9 to 2.1 (-35%, P less than 0.001), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The cause of the degeneration of dopamine-containing cells in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. 
Indeed, recent studies of post-mortem brain tissue have suggested the presence of an on-going toxic process in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease leading to excess lipid peroxidation. 
Piribedil is used in the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease and is particularly effective against tremor. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease the beneficial effects of piribedil may be limited by nausea and drowsiness. 
However, pre-treatment with the peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone prevents the unwanted effects and piribedil produces a profound and longer-lasting reversal of all components of the motor syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  A group of ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) was tested on a series of automated tests of learning, memory, planning and attention whilst either on or off L-dopa medication. 
This suggests that GM1 or other trophic factor therapies may be fruitful treatment strategies for a disorder of nigrostriatal function such as Parkinson's disease. 
In subjects with Parkinson's disease the MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl exerts a L-dopa-sparing effect, prolongs L-dopa action and seems to have a favorable influence regarding on-off disabilities. 
 The development of fluctuations in disability are a main problem of the levodopa long-term treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
The early combination of low doses of levodopa with a dopamine agonist as lisuride improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease as much as a monotherapy but prevents the development of fluctuations in disability and dyskinesias at the same time. 
Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the Parkinson's disease patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning, including daily exercise, physical therapy, and involvement with support groups. 
 Neurogenic bladder frequently occurs in Parkinson's disease. 
 Tolerability is one of the main problems of the long-term use of antiparkinsonian drugs, especially in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. 
 Iron-induced oxidant stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
An increasing body of evidence now indicates that in Parkinson's disease the environment within the substantia nigra is conducive to the formation of cytotoxic free radicals and cell degeneration. 
This hypothesis has attracted considerable attention because it opens the way for employing antioxidant strategies as possible neuroprotective treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Although the concept is appealing, free radicals have not yet been proven to play a role in Parkinson's disease, and many important issues remain to be resolved before the oxidative hypothesis can ultimately be confirmed or refuted. 
 High dosages of a combination of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbate were administered to patients with early Parkinson's disease as an open-labeled trial and pilot study to test the endogenous toxic hypothesis of the etiology of Parkinson's disease. 
Results of this pilot study suggest that the progression of Parkinson's disease may be slowed by administration of these antioxidants. 
 Recent studies in Parkinson's disease suggest that the degeneration of the nigrostriatal melanin-containing dopaminergic neurons results from toxic effects of free radicals, which are generated during dopamine metabolism in the substantia nigra (SN). 
 Advance in understanding of the anatomy, physiology and pharmacology of basal ganglia organisation over the past decade revealed a functional relation between excitatory glutamatergic and the degenerated dopaminergic nigrostriatal transmitter systems which could serve as targets for pharmacological interventions in Parkinson's disease. 
The selective AMPA-antagonist NBQX is not effective in animal models of Parkinson's disease when given alone but ameliorates parkinsonian symptomatology and enhances the locomotor response of a threshold dose of L-DOPA. 
Here we report that, in the latter model, such synergism of NBQX is also seen with the direct dopamine agonists lisuride and apomorphine, indicating the potential usefulness of AMPA antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The article summarizes historical aspects and current concepts of the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Levodopa, anticholinergic substances, direct dopamine agonists, amantadine, L-deprenyl are used to treat motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
Treatment of non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and supportive therapies are discussed in the article. 
These tremors were diagnosed as 'forme fruste' of the essential tremor, not the incipient stage of Parkinson's disease. 
 Transplantation of dopaminergic neurons derived from fetal or adrenal tissue into the striatum is a potentially useful treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In order to quantify the beneficial impact of early combination therapy, a controlled clinical trial (PRADO: PRA videl1 + DO pa) in patients with early Parkinson's disease was carried out, whereby L-Dopa monotherapy (in a fixed combination with benserazide (DoBe) was being compared with the same combination plus bromocriptine (DoBeBro). 
Both groups were homogeneous at baseline in all observed parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Amantadine is generally used in the prophylaxis of infection with influenza A, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and in the treatment of neuroleptic side effects. 
In the brains of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with levodopa, a significant reduction of PST activities was observed in hypothalamus, frontal and temporal cortex, amygdaloid nucleus, occipital and parietal cortex (between 20 and 38.8% of controls). 
 Ultrastructural and biochemical properties of caudate nucleus (CN) biopsies in two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) were compared with three CN specimens removed during surgery for intracranial tumors. 
 In the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients with Parkinson's disease treated with L-DOPA, L-3-O-methyldopa was the major metabolite of administered L-DOPA. 
Some of these agonists are tested for their potential effects in Parkinson's disease (high intrinsic efficacy), while others are tested for potential anti-psychotic effects (low intrinsic efficacy). 
The near future will show whether the compounds under evaluation hold promise for being new, valuable medicines for treating major diseases like Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 The management of patients with early Parkinson's disease should now take into account the possibility that MAO-B inhibitors may provide neuroprotective therapy, that dopamine undergoes oxidative metabolism and has the potential to generate cytotoxic free radicals, and that the early employment of drugs which provide sustained central dopamine agonism may delay the development of adverse effects associated with chronic levodopa therapy. 
The aim of treatment for patients with early Parkinson's disease is to utilize strategies designed to address these issues without compromising clinical control. 
The author briefly reviewed the history of treatment of Parkinson's disease, and current and future trends in its drug therapy as an introductory remark. 
The treatment of Parkinson's disease seems to be moving slowly from mere symptomatic therapy to the one which is aiming the protection of nigral cells. 
Several lines of evidence suggest that a degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra produces the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
 An antiserum against cabergoline, a powerful dopamine-agonist under clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinemia, has been raised in rabbits by immunization with an immunogen produced by conjugation of cabergoline to bovine serum albumin. 
The plasma concentrations at the steady state in a patient with Parkinson's disease who had received the drug at single oral daily doses of 3, 5 and 7 mg were determined using the assay. 
 Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD) may be classified into three main categories: "On" dyskinesias, diphasic dyskinesias (DD), and "off" periods. 
 Parkinson's disease, a neurologic disorder characterized by a dopamine deficit within the striatum, may be improved by transplantation of polymer encapsulated neurosecretory cells. 
 Treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be divided into two categories: symptomatic therapy (restoring dopamine levels toward normal and reversing functional disability) and preventive therapy (interfering with the pathophysiologic mechanism of PD to prevent or decrease the rate of progression of the disease). 
It is suggested that initial treatment of Parkinson's disease begin with both preventive therapy with selegiline and symptomatic treatment with the sustained-release preparation of levodopa, which may be associated with fewer long-term complications. 
 Continuous dopaminergic stimulation has been shown to stabilize motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who do not respond to more conventional forms of therapy. 
 It is shown that the specific inter- and subregional patterns of striatal dopamine loss in idiopathic Parkinson's disease can serve as a criterion for the evaluation of neurotoxic processes suggested to play an etiological role in this disorder. 
Based on this premise, the possibility is examined that dopamine-based free radicals (oxidative stress), or a MPTP-like mechanism may be the primary cause of the substantia nigra cell death in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Based on comparative clinical and morphometric studies in 45 autopsy cases of Parkinson's disease (PD), 27 clinically presenting with akinesia and rigidity (AR-type), 18 with predominant resting tremor (T-type), the neurobiological basis of the major clinical subtypes in PD is discussed. 
Amantadine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease without a well established mechanism of action. 
 The role of the dopaminergic system in the pathogenesis of migraine was studied by evaluating the course of migraine after the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD) in 5 migraineurs. 
More recently their pharmacological action on dopamine receptors has been exploited to treat post-partum bleeding, migraine, Parkinson's disease and senile dementia. 
The results suggest that the selected dosage schedule produces a widespread and lasting neuronal degeneration closely resembling the neurochemical pathology of Parkinson's disease. 
 Systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) gives rise to motor deficits in humans and other primates which closely resemble those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The relevance of the MPTP model to idiopathic Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 Elevated iron concentrations in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta have been implicated in the development of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Because, as a transitional metal, iron promotes free radical formation, the role of iron in the degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease has received much attention. 
The present study indicates that the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons are susceptible to the presence of ionic iron and thus supports the assumption that iron initiates dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 The vulnerability of substantia nigral (SN) melaninized dopamine neurons to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and the selective increases of iron and basal lipid peroxidation in SN indicate that iron-melanin interaction could be crucial to the pathogenesis of this disease. 
In the absence of an identifiable exogenous or endogenous neurotoxin in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, iron-melanin interaction in pars compacta of SN may be a strong candidate for the cytotoxic component of oxygen radical-induced neurodegeneration of melaninized dopamine neurons. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show a good response to levodopa in the morning, and reduced duration or complete failure of response later in the day, but the pathophysiology of this phenomenon remains unclear. 
 Motor fluctuations often complicate chronic levodopa treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The above data suggest the possibility of plastic modifications of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease, and a potential deleterious effect of intermittent oral therapy. 
The charts of 804 men younger than 50 years were reviewed, and patients were excluded if they had not taken dopamine blockers, had taken them for more than 1 month, had received concomitant antiparkinsonian agents, had focal brain lesions or histories of Parkinson's disease or meningitis, had used cocaine, amphetamines, or opiates within 1 month of admission, or, among the comparison group, had HIV risk factors. 
Treatment with repeated subcutaneous injections was started in 13 patients who had suffered from Parkinson's disease for more than ten years. 
 We determined concentrations of 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), dopamine (DA) and other related substances in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 15 h after L-dopa/carbidopa medication, and compared patients with and without the wearing-off phenomenon. 
The possible relevance of these findings to Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
 Transplantation of adrenal chromaffin cells into the striatum of Parkinson's disease patients is unlikely to become a reliable therapy unless techniques are devised to improve cell survival. 
The prevalence of the A1 allele was not significantly increased in patients with depression, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, or obesity. 
 Intracerebral grafting of dopamine containing adrenal chromaffin cells to the brain of experimental animals can ameliorate the symptoms of experimentally induced Parkinson's disease. 
Clinical trials of adrenal autograft to the patients with Parkinson's disease are on-going with variable results and autopsy cases show poor survivability of grafted chromaffin cells. 
Considering these results, we suggest that methods to increase the survivability of grafted chromaffin cells be explored more deeply because such survivability might be closely related to the functional recovery of patients with Parkinson's disease, using this grafting procedure. 
 Current knowledge of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) has largely been obtained from studies of chronically treated patients in whom effects of disease chronicity, treatment, depression and dementia are confounding factors. 
 We measured sequential plasma and CSF levodopa and CSF dopamine sulfate levels following a single dose of levodopa/carbidopa in two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
A hypothesis is then presented that attempts to synthesize from these facts a view of the electrophysiological functioning of midbrain dopamine systems that may be helpful in understanding brain mechanisms underlying the pathology of such disorders as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 The dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine has been used successfully to treat on-off swings in Parkinson's disease. 
Its value as a predictor of dopa responsiveness in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) was assessed and its potential role in differentiating IPD from the Parkinsonian plus syndromes (PPS) of multisystem atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and olivopontocerebellar atrophy was investigated. 
administration to 13 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These results show dopamine antagonist activity of terguride in patients with Parkinson's disease treated with Levodopa. 
 Pergolide, a dopamine agonist effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in the carrageenan paw edema assay in rats at p.o. 
The assessment of the clinical potential of transplanting encapsulated adrenal chromaffin cells of either allo- or xenogeneic origin for Parkinson's disease will require long-term behavioral studies. 
 Neurotransmitters other than dopamine, including neuropeptides, could have important pathophysiologic and therapeutic roles in Parkinson's disease. 
MERGL levels increased with advancing age among normal individuals but not among patients with Parkinson's disease. 
This difference may be due to a lower D1 receptor reserve in primate than in rodent tissue and suggests that only selective D1 agonists with full efficacy at D1 receptors can be expected to have beneficial effects in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 In later stages of the disease, patients with Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa may become severely disabled by pronounced and sudden motor fluctuations called "the on-off syndrome". 
Nine levodopa treated patients with Parkinson's disease and severe on-off syndrome received apomorphine. 
These data show that indistinguishable nigral, presynaptic parkinsonism occurs in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and in patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and also how a favorable response to levodopa is neither synonymous with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, nor does it exclude multiple-system, atrophy-related parkinsonism. 
 Parkinson's disease has been associated with defects in oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos). 
We analyzed mitochondria isolated from muscle biopsies of 6 patients with Parkinson's disease for deficiencies in Oxphos enzymes and for mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. 
A genetic basis for Parkinson's disease was suggested by the presence of affected relatives of 2 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that Parkinson's disease is a systemic disorder of Oxphos, probably of a complex genetic etiology. 
So it may be more feasible for behavioral and pharmacological studies of Parkinson's disease. 
 The motor deficits associated with Parkinson's disease may be ameliorated by intrastriatal placement of dopamine-secreting cells in a polymer capsule. 
 Current long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease is inadequate, and improved symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies are needed. 
Recent interest has focused on the use of antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor in Parkinson's disease. 
Abnormally increased activity of the subthalamic nucleus is postulated to play a central pathophysiological role in the signs of Parkinson's disease, and NMDA antagonists may provide a means of decreasing this activity selectively. 
Moreover, NMDA antagonists provide profound protection of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra in the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and methamphetamine models of Parkinson's disease. 
The clinical use of NMDA antagonists may prove useful in Parkinson's disease to treat symptoms and retard disease progression. 
Thus, combined treatment with dopamine agonists selective for each of the D1 and D2 receptors may be an effective therapy for Parkinson's disease, chiefly characterized by loss of central dopamine-containing neurons. 
We looked for changes of these innervations in cases with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were investigated in 49 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 33 age-matched controls with [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiroperidol as ligands respectively.

Our result suggests that lipid peroxidation might be involved in the degenerative process of neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Ninety-four patients with early Parkinson's disease were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of MK-458 [hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/lactose matrix (HPMC)], a sustained release formulation of a novel naphthoxazine compound with selective D-2 dopamine receptor agonism. 
MK-458 (HPMC) possesses antiparkinsonian efficacy in early Parkinson's disease; however, side-effects are frequently associated with its use. 
Selective D-2 receptor agonists, such as MK-458 (HPMC), may not be the ideal treatment as monotherapy for Parkinson's disease. 
 Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. 
[18F]dopa positron emmission tomographic findings were compared with 30 normal controls and 16 patients with sporadic, L-dopa-responsive, Parkinson's disease. 
Caudate and anterior putamen [18F]dopa uptake were normal in patients with neuroacanthocytosis, but mean posterior putamen [18F]dopa uptake was reduced to 42% of normal, similar to that in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The development of reliable preclinical detection procedures for idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be the fundamental advance required for the establishment of the cause, the natural history, and ultimately, the prevention of this neurodegenerative disorder. 
The density of the binding of 3H-NMS was also significantly lower in a subgroup of old subjects with Down's syndrome (DS), whereas no changes were found in younger individuals with DS or in patients with Parkinson's disease, whether they were demented or not, multi-infarct dementia, myasthenia gravis or epilepsy. 
 Almost all patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa and progress steadily, requiring an increased overall dosage with time. 
This study evaluated 20 patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease who were treated with Sinemet CR4 over a 1-year period. 
Of the withdrawals, two subjects died from non-Parkinson's disease-related illness, three showed no therapeutic benefit, and four responded well for a minimal 6-month period, but then lost therapeutic benefit and developed more severe dystonias. 
As the number of cells decrease, for example in Parkinson's disease and in animals with midbrain dopaminergic cell lesions, the activity of their remaining cells increases. 
Transplantation of dopamine neurons in humans may prove to be a useful therapy in Parkinson's disease, in which a severe movement disorder is associated with degeneration of the dopamine system. 
This finding indicates that postprandial hypotension is an early marker of autonomic failure in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and suggests the usefulness of evaluating cardiopressor response to a standard meal before starting new DA-agonist therapy in PD. 
 A variety of neuropharmacologic agents, including anticholinergic drugs, amantadine hydrochloride, levodopa, selegiline, bromocriptine, and pergolide, are now available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Event-related potentials and reaction time measures to auditory discrimination tasks of graded difficulty were used to separate cognitive from motor processing time in 27 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated Parkinson's disease and later on optimal levodopa treatment. 
In early Parkinson's disease cognitive processing time remains normal but the motor processing time is prolonged. 
 Sweating and superficial vasodilator responses were studied in 22 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease in order to evaluate the thermoregulatory function.

 A subset of demented elderly patients exhibit large numbers of cortical intraneuronal inclusions similar to the neurofilament (NF)-rich Lewy bodies (LB) found in pigmented subcortical neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The relationship between oxidative polymorphisms and the cause of Parkinson's disease is controversial. 
 The introduction of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease had modified both the prognosis and the current concepts of the disease, Although levodopa remains the most potent drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, its long-term use is associated with fluctuations in motor performance, abnormal movements and psychotic hallucinations. 
This paper reviews some recent developments in the pharmacology of Parkinson's disease. 
Recent findings indicate that not only central dopamine but also several other central neurotransmitter and receptor changes are involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
New data on autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease are presented. 
Thus, the present data show that M-3-PTP is devoid of dopaminergic toxicity in mouse brain and is not likely to produce Parkinson's disease in humans. 
Benefits from this treatment are lasting, and the problems associated with long-term L-dopa therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease are generally absent. 
Similar data have been calculated for a group of 10 healthy control subjects and 10 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In the atypical patient, however, we found a greater reduction of [18F]dopa uptake into both caudate and putamen, comparable with that in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 This study aimed to find a possible biochemical basis for the frequent epidemiological observation of a negative correlation between smoking and Parkinson's disease. 
Our findings suggest that both MAO inhibition and cytochrome P450 induction may play a role in any biochemical protection afforded by cigarette smoke exposure against the development of Parkinson's disease. 
 Administration of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to rat brain causes biochemical and neuroanatomical changes to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Thus, antagonists at the NMDA receptor may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We treated 20 early Parkinson's disease subjects with the dopamine agonist lisuride in combination with the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (L-deprenyl). 
 The purpose of the present investigation was to study the effects of simultaneous manipulations of central cholinergic, adrenergic and glutamatergic systems on locomotion in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The potent and selective dopamine D-2 agonist, MK-458 [PHNO; (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine] was administered as monotherapy to nine patients with Parkinson's disease in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week investigation; ten other patients were randomized to placebo. 
The results showed a retrograde cytotoxic effect of 6-OHDA from the striatal terminals to their dopaminergic neuronal perikarya in the SN, and suggest the possibility that the striatum may be a primary locus in the degeneration process in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease involves the progressive degeneration of dopamine neurons in the extrapyramidal motor system. 
 For decades clinicians have postulated a characteristic preexisting personality in patients who develop Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contains an antibody that immunocytochemically reacts with dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). 
 This paper is a preliminary report of work aiming to elucidate the possible use of 5-S-cysteinyl metabolites of catechols in the cerebrospinal fluid as markers in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 The development of reliable preclinical detection procedures for idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be the fundamental advance required for the establishment of the cause, the natural history, and ultimately, the prevention of this neurodegenerative disorder. 
These findings are discussed in terms of their relevance to Parkinson's disease and tardive dyskinesia. 
 Inconsistencies in the response to individual levodopa doses occur in most patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). 
The early onset of schizophrenia by comparison to Parkinson's disease may explain why schizophrenia entails more pronounced positive symptoms, development deficits, and cognitive, social, and emotional impairments. 
 Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. 
In the present study, we compared the ability of dopamine-secreting cells, encapsulated by 2 different methods, to reverse experimental Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor disturbances due to a lack of dopamine within the striatum following degeneration of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway. 
In Parkinson's disease different hypotheses might explain the inexorable aggravation of gait disorders along the course of the disease: (1) an advancing disorder of coordination between postural control and locomotion, (2) if some gait parameters like stride length and kinematic parameters are Dopa-sensitive, the others are Dopa-resistant and thus may involve other mechanisms than dopamine deficiency. 
 Direct acting dopamine agonists are generally less effective than levodopa in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 
This central noradrenergic system is involved in the neurophysiology and the clinical features of cerebral aging (ideation-motor and cognitive function slowing down, loss of behavioral adjustment), neuro-degenerative disorders (SDAT, Parkinson's disease), certain aspects of depression and less obvious conditions (head injuries, sequelae of cerebrovascular accidents, sub-cortical dementia). 
Our data confirm that the wearing off of the levodopa effect in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease is a function of drug concentration in the central nervous system. 
The in vivo kinetics of [123I]IBZM were studied in patients with unilateral and bilateral accentuated idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Selegiline (deprenyl) is a selective inhibitor of cerebral monoamine oxidase type B at the dosage (10 mg/day) used in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Whichever mechanism(s) is responsible, there is strong evidence to suggest that selegiline should be considered both in patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in an attempt to delay symptom progression, and in those experiencing dose-dependent fluctuations in response to levodopa. 
Therefore, it is suggested that these receptors may play a critical role in the physiology (control of excitability, pacemaker firing, and dendritic DA release) as well as pathology (neuronal death in Parkinson's disease, psychosis, and mechanism of action of drugs of abuse, such as ethanol) related to DA neurons. 
Dopamine receptors are primary targets for drugs used in the treatment of psychomotor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
Both receptors are primary targets for drugs used to treat many psychomotor diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
Blink rate may provide a nonintrusive measure of central dopamine activity that would help to evaluate the progress of Parkinson's disease or treatments which attempt to restore dopamine function. 
 A selective increase in content of iron in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra has been implicated in the biochemical pathology of Parkinson's disease. 
The ability of iron chelators to retard dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra may indicate a new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The authors investigated the relation between dynamic changes of D1 and D2 receptor subtypes and the animal behavior, and speculate on the possible mechanisms of deterioration of drug effect and appearance of AIM induced by DA agonists during the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 This study examined whether a relationship exists between the degree of dopamine (DA) loss and the changes in opioid (Met5-enkephalin, ME; dynorphin A (1-8) (DYN)) or tachykinin (substance P, SP) peptidergic systems in basal ganglia (caudate and putamen) and limbic (frontal cortex) regions of postmortem tissue samples derived from patients who died of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We report heretofore undescribed clinical and histological features of a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who showed marked and persistent motoric benefit from an adrenal medulla autograft for 18 months following grafting. 
 CQA 206-291, a mixed D1-D2 receptor agonist that also possesses dualistic dopamine antagonist-agonist properties, was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in individuals with Parkinson's disease of moderate severity. 
CQA appears to be an effective, well-tolerated agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Although originally described in patients receiving neuroleptic drugs, this syndrome may also occur in patients with Parkinson's disease during withdrawal or reduction of levodopa therapy or other dopaminergic drug therapy. 
These cases illustrate the variety of circumstances in which alteration of therapy with dopaminergic drugs can cause this syndrome and the relative unfamiliarity of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome-levodopa relationship among physicians who do not treat large numbers of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
No neuronal degeneration associated with gliosis or release of melanin granules, such as seen in Parkinson's disease, was observed. 
 Cross-species transplantation of dopamine-releasing cell lines protected against immune rejection by a semi-permeable synthetic membrane may provide a source of neurotransmitters for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These findings suggest that the TIDA impairment described in Parkinson's disease develops along with the progressive course of the extrapyramidal involvement and is strictly correlated with the dopamine-dependence of the motor impairment. 
 The subjects were 20 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The bromocriptine-TRH test was performed in 11 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and in 10 control subjects. 
This study indicate that it may be feasible to utilize autotransplantation of genetically modified Schwann cells to alleviate the movement disorders in Parkinson's disease. 
These findings demonstrate a differential influence of the morphinan stereoisomers dextrorphan and levorphanol on experimental catalepsy, and suggest a potential use of dextromethorphan in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 There is little information concerning the effects of norepinephrine (NE) depletion on clinical features of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Because of the importance of the catecholamine system in Parkinson's disease and its relevance to a variety of clinical movement disorders, catecholamine uptake sites were mapped in the human brain using [3H] mazindol autoradiography. 
 Protracted long-term treatment of common marmosets with 15 doses (0.5-4.5 mg/kg, i.p.) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; total dose 25 mg/kg, given over 29 days) caused transitory changes in motor behaviour reminiscent of human Parkinson's disease. 
In terms of long-term administration of anticholinergics, patients with Parkinson's disease often display memory deficits. 
 The main objective of this study was to determine whether the activation of dopaminergic pathways, through adrenal-caudate transplantation, stimulated the production of dopamine and salsolinol in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The results of this study demonstrated that the replacement of degenerative nigrostriatal neurons with new dopamine-producing cells by adrenal brain transplants in patients with Parkinson's disease resulted in significant increase (p less than 0.05) in CSF levels of free dopamine, dopamine sulfate, free salsolinol, and salsolinol sulfate as compared with preoperative levels. 
The results are discussed in the context of differential deficits shown by patients with Parkinson's disease in simple versus choice reaction time performance, and of the functions of parallel corticostriatal loops subserving the normal control of action. 
This mechanism of neuronal loss may play an important role in the degeneration in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease, because the catechols and iron are abundant in this region. 
Together, the present findings demonstrate that bilateral intrahypothalamic administration of 6-OHDA results in the appearance of the three cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease in rats. 
These recent developments have provided new therapeutic perspectives for the management of Parkinson's disease and seizure disorders via the use of selective inhibitors and amino acid amine prodrug substrates of MAO-B. 
 The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of neurotensin in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Ongoing clinical trials with fetal tissue transplants in Parkinson's disease would be facilitated by an effective tissue storage technique that would allow for temporal separation of the procurement of the fetal donor tissue and implantation surgery. 
 To explore the possible therapeutic use of electric convulsive treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD), the authors examined the biochemical effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on dopaminergic systems in a rodent model of PD, induced with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 
 A 77-year-old woman with a 9 years history of Parkinson's disease was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, disturbance of consciousness, increased muscular rigidity and abnormal involuntary movements. 
Patients with Parkinson's disease have been suspected to have a low incidence of DIC, and this may be the first case report on successful treatment of levodopa-induced NMS with DIC in the patient with Parkinson's disease. 
 The involvement of oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has been suggested for some time. 
In addition, various theories of induction of Parkinson's disease are discussed in relation to the possible involvement of oxygen radicals. 
 Energy expenditure was determined in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, 6 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with essential tremor, age-matched, using the indirect calorimetric method which measures the gas exchange rate. 
We suggest that chronic low-dose MPTP induced cognitive dysfunction in primates may not only be a model for the cognitive disturbances that accompany Parkinson's disease but may also aid in understanding the cognitive dysfunction seen in children with ADD. 
 Depression is the major psychiatric complication of Parkinson's disease, and it occurs in approximately one-third of all cases. 
 The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of pros-methylimidazoleacetic acid (p-MIAA) in thirteen medication-free patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease were highly correlated (Spearman's rho = 0.749, p less than 0.005) with the severity of signs of the disease as scored on the Columbia University Rating Scale. 
Elucidation of the processes that regulate formation and disposition of p-MIAA in brain and information on the neural effects of p-MIAA, its precursors and its putative metabolites may yield insight into factors that regulate the progression of Parkinson's disease, and may shed additional light on the cause(s) of this disease. 
The continuation of L-DOPA therapy may not adversely affect fetal graft survival and growth in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Chronic L-DOPA treatment of Parkinson's disease frequently leads to the development of motoric overstimulation and hyperkinetic movements. 
The results support the hypothesis that deficient locus coeruleus noradrenergic mechanisms underlie the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
The possible negative interactions of coadministration with COMT inhibitors and predominantly peripherally acting AADC inhibitors must be considered when used in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 The objectives of this review are, first, to summarize results from clinical trials on patients with Parkinson's disease using grafts of either adrenal medulla or fetal substantia nigra and, second, to discuss some of the scientific issues that need to be clarified in more detail before transplantation can become a real therapeutic alternative in Parkinson's disease. 
It is concluded that adrenal medulla autotransplantation is an experimental approach and not a treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
Together with the solid animal experimental data the clinical observations support the idea that neural transplantation can be developed into an effective therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 Pergolide is a potent, direct-acting dopamine agonist used in treating Parkinson's disease. 
A growing body of evidence suggests that pergolide does occupy and activate D1 receptors in vivo, although the relevance to therapeutic efficacy in Parkinson's disease needs further study. 
Similarly, mechanisms of plasticity have been shown to be relevant in human postmortem and Positron Emission Tomographic studies of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Over recent years I have been studying whether dopamine agonist treatment alone, or in early combination with levodopa, might institute a better long-term treatment in Parkinson's disease than levodopa alone. 
Indeed, early combination of levodopa with bromocriptine, pergolide or lisuride has indicated that this kind of treatment results in better management of Parkinson's disease with fewer fluctuations in disability, especially end-of-dose disturbances and dyskinesias, than treatment with levodopa alone. 
Thus, the possible efficacy of selegiline in slowing down the progression of Parkinson's disease requires further investigations. 
As a new treatment strategy it appears advisable to initiate the dopaminergic treatment in early Parkinson's disease by using initially selegiline and a dopamine agonist and by adding levodopa when the therapeutic response is insufficient. 
 Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) shows a topographical organisation where the lateral part of the SN is more affected. 
DATATOP has pointed to the potential for arresting the progression of Parkinson's disease, and has provided an unparalleled opportunity to study the clinical course and neurochemical indices of untreated Parkinsonism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Four aspects about monoamine oxidase (MAO; E.C. 
1.4.3.4) are of obvious interest in relation to Parkinson's disease and its treatment with the irreversible and selective MAO-B inhibitor L-deprenyl and are discussed in this review: 1) To what extent the two forms of MAO are of importance for the deamination of dopamine and to what degree MAO localised inside and outside of dopaminergic nerve terminals contributes 2) The kinetics of the MAO-protein, i.e. 
 The cause of dopamine cell death in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. 
Altered mitochondrial function and increased iron levels may not initiate Parkinson's disease but rather act to accelerate cell death. 
Future strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease should be aimed at preventing oxidative stress and stopping or slowing the progression of the underlying pathology. 
 The study of subtle changes in motor and cognitive function after exposure to MPTP might serve as a guide to the very earliest stages of Parkinson's disease. 
What guidance they provide in the study of subclinical or preclinical Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
In a clinical study 17 patients with Parkinson's disease received a transplantation of human fetal adrenal medullary tissue, which was cultured for one week and then transplanted into the head of both caudate nuclei. 
 This paper examines fresh the evidence for an inverse relationship between smoking behaviour and Parkinson's disease. 
The frequent epidemiological observation, that the relative risk of a smoker having Parkinson's disease is approximately 0.5 that of a non-smoker, is fairly well established. 
Despite much biochemical work suggesting a protective role for cigarette smoke against the development of Parkinson's disease, the epidemiological data points away from such a mechanism. 
Instead, the epidemiological work favours two alternative hypotheses: either that there is selective mortality of smokers with Parkinson's disease such that their conditions deteriorate and death occurs at an accelerated rate (resulting in fewer smokers with Parkinson's disease-especially in the older age groups when Parkinson's disease is most common), or that the latent phase of Parkinson's disease (before symptoms become apparent) involves subtle personality changes producing the so-called Parkinsonian personality and an associated aversion to cigarette smoking. 
The latter changes may be a consequence of progressive nigrostriatal dopamine depletion resulting eventually in Parkinson's disease. 
Future approaches that would allow a more definitive understanding of the processes underlying the intriguing link between smoking and Parkinson's disease are considered. 
 Delaying levodopa therapy by a drug currently is being perceived by patients and doctors as an indication for a beneficial effect on the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
Data obtained with this technique in human post mortem brain specimens indicate that the analysis of tissues and body fluids for dopamine conjugates is useful for profiling metabolic dopamine activity in controls and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. 
In vivo imaging techniques and methods for quantification are briefly described and PET and SPECT studies of D2 receptors in schizophrenia, under neuroleptic treatment, in aging, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, tardive dyskinesia and multisystem atrophies are reviewed and compared with our own results. 
 We address, from a pharmacokinetic viewpoint, the important question of why some patients with clinical idiopathic Parkinson's disease experience a fall off in benefit from levodopa maintenance therapy. 
The amount by, and time for which, the plasma levodopa concentration exceeds any critical threshold for the competitive active uptake process into the brain may thus decrease with duration of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Early case reports note marked improvements in the signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) in several patients with coexisting psychiatric disorders after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). 
These results suggest that modifications of D2 receptor gene expression may be part of the biological events that lead to the movement disorders induced by neuroleptic drugs or Parkinson's disease. 
 In an attempt to define neurochemically the part played by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as a potential Parkinson's disease-inducing neurotoxin, we measured the tissue concentrations of the monoamines dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin in 45 brain regions in nine rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) receiving repeated intramuscular injections of a total amount of 2.1-7.5 mg/kg MPTP-HCl. 
Our study demonstrates that in the rhesus monkey MPTP mimicked, in addition to the profound striatal dopamine loss, some of the extrastriatal dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin changes often seen in the brain of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
However, using our treatment regimen, we have not been able to reproduce in the rhesus monkey the inter-regional pattern of striatal dopamine loss typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, i.e. 
 Cholinergic and monoaminergic (dopaminergic and serotonergic) activities have been examined in postmortem brain tissue in senile dementia of Lewy body type, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. 
However, the chronic treatment of aged marmosets with MPTP does not reproduce the neuropeptide alterations characteristic of Parkinson's disease. 
 In four human controls, four cases of Parkinson's disease and three cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis analysis of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and the metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was performed in various segments of postmortem spinal cord. 
In the present study we grafted cell lines, expressing the form I of human tyrosine hydroxylase after infection with a recombinant retrovirus and selection in tyrosine-free-medium, to the denervated striatum in order to analyse the extent to which extracellular dopamine levels can be restored and the effect of a diffuse release of dopamine on motor impairement in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. 
These favourable characteristics have been applied in the treatment of Parkinson's disease using selegiline both with levodopa and alone. 
 With the intention of compensating for the deficit of endogenous dopamine (DA) in the basal ganglia of Parkinsonian patients by substitution with agents which directly stimulate central DA receptors, synthetic DA agonists have been introduced almost 20 years ago for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
However, undoubtedly DA agonists have improved therapeutic possibilities in Parkinson's disease. 
The pathophysiology underlying Parkinson's disease which turned out more complex than initially expected might provide another explanation for the limited therapeutic potential of DA agonists. 
In addition, the dramatic changes observed in the somatostatinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, an area involved in the control of food and water intake, may be related to some aspects of the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease. 
These results support the continued clinical assessment of ropinirole for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
This review presents the theoretical rationale, recent research advances, and clinical implications for adults with diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease; we also describe in utero transplantation of fetal hematopoietic stem cells and hepatocytes for the treatment of inherited hematologic and hepatic deficiencies, as well as the use of fetal islet cells and dopamine-producing cells to treat postnatal conditions. 
 Certain clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) (speech or/and balance disturbances) are not linked to brain dopamine deficiency. 
Evidence supporting similar processes being responsible for nigrostriatal dopamine neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease is now becoming available. 
In conclusion, nanomolar L-DOPA facilitates the S of DA via presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors at concentrations lower than those required to induce conversion to DA even in striatal slices from the MPTP-treated mice model for Parkinson's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The present study shows that systemic dopamine receptor blockade impaired movement initiation of rats, trained in a simple reaction time task for rapid initiation of locomotion in response to a combined optic/acoustic cue. 
The haloperidol-induced movement initiation deficits in this task are in part comparable to akinesia seen in Parkinson's disease and their reversal by dizocilpine has implications for the treatment of this disease. 
Severe movement disorders result from the loss of striatal dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a model for Parkinson's disease and show alterations in gene expression in the two major output systems of the striatum to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. 
 A group of healthy control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease were investigated using positron emission tomography and two tracers as indicators of different specific properties of the presynaptic dopaminergic system in caudate nucleus and putamen. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, striatal uptake of both tracers was decreased, putamen being significantly more affected than caudate. 
Adrenal medullary grafts to the patients with Parkinson's disease are currently under way in a large number of hospitals and we suggest more consideration be given to methods which lead to enhance the grafted chromaffin cell survival, since those survivability might be closely related to the functional recovery of these patients. 
 Striatal dopamine D-1 receptor binding was investigated in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) in five patients with early Parkinson's disease using [11C]-SCH 23390. 
Thus, the present results show that the behaviour of striatal D-1 and D-2 receptors is different in early Parkinson's disease. 
The findings provide a rationale for testing different hypotheses regarding the neurobiological substrates of mesostriatal injury in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Furthermore, we propose the present model utilizing chronic low-dose exposure to MPTP as a model for the early, compensated form of Parkinson's disease. 
 In animal models of hemi-Parkinson's disease, survival of grafted nigral cells, their synaptic connections, dopamine (DA) synthesis/release, and recovery from motor disturbances were investigated, and these were compared among 3 groups of animals raised for 3 months, 1 year and 2 years after the transplantation. 
 The magnitude and pattern of motor responses to single doses of subcutaneous apomorphine and oral levodopa were compared in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These clinical observations support the notion that integrity of striatal post-synaptic dopamine receptors is a key determinant of responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
 CQA 206-291, a new ergot derivative with a "biphasic" dopaminergic profile, was studied in 6 patients with longstanding Parkinson's disease suffering from pronounced fluctuations in hourly mobility. 
The peripheral implantation of polymer systems containing levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists, or other anti-Parkinson agents may constitute a novel technology of drug delivery to improve the care of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine and it metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were measured in the retinas of eight patients with Parkinson's disease who died. 
This study is the first direct evidence to the authors' knowledge that retinal dopamine concentration is decreased in Parkinson's disease, as it is in the nigrostriatal pathway. 
These results may be important in the design of pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease and the combination of drug and neural grafting therapies in this disorder. 
Recently, some studies have suggested the possibility that oxygen radical mechanisms might be involved in the development of the dopamine neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The positive-negative distinction of schizophrenia has emerged as a valid means of clarifying its heterogeneity. 
Based on this evidence, we suggest that schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms might be managed like patients with Parkinson's disease, namely, with dopaminergic drugs and MAO-B inhibitors. 
Research areas discussed included the effects of dopamine-rich grafts in animal models of Parkinson's disease and acetylcholine-rich grafts in animals with lesions of the cholinergic pathways to the neocortex and hippocampus. 
 We investigated tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the medulla oblongata corresponding to the A1 and A2 cell groups in autopsy tissue of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 3), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 3), striatonigral degeneration (SND) (n = 2), and in controls (n = 4). 
 This review summarizes basic and clinical research on intracerebral adrenal medulla grafts, emphasizing potential applications to Parkinson's disease. 
The evidence for direct dopamine-mediated effects as compared to trophic mechanisms of action for these grafts in animal models for Parkinson's disease is presented. 
In view of the available evidence suggesting increased striatal output, and reduced unit activity within the GPL of the MPTP-treated primate, it seems likely that the striatal GABAergic output to the GPL is overactive in this model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The MPTP-treated monkey has become an important model for the study of Parkinson's disease. 
This interregional pattern of striatal DA deficits is similar to that seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The changes in L-Dopa metabolism by COMT inhibitor warrant further clinical studies in Parkinson's disease. 
We suggest that MPTP-treated C57BL/6 mice may serve as a suitable model for Parkinson's disease. 
 A distinct pattern of neuropsychological deficits was associated with low homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cerebrospinal fluid of 21 patients with: Alzheimer's disease (9), Parkinson's disease (8) and major depressive disorders (4). 
 Previous studies have not agreed on the incidence of ischemic stroke in persons with Parkinson's disease. 
There are epidemiologic and neurochemical facets of Parkinson's disease that might confer some benefit or protection against ischemic stroke. 
We used a case-control method to determine the lifetime history of ischemic stroke in 200 patients with Parkinson's disease and 200 controls of a similar age range. 
The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly less in the patients with Parkinson's disease than in the controls, as was the cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction. 
Among risk factors, significantly fewer patients with Parkinson's disease used tobacco than controls. 
The decreased incidence of ischemic stroke in the patients with Parkinson's disease appears to be related to their less severe generalized atherosclerosis, possibly due to their lower incidence of tobacco use. 
In view of the known potential for dopamine to exacerbate experimental ischemic tissue damage, the possibility that the dopamine deficiency in the central nervous system of persons with Parkinson's disease confers an additional specific protective benefit against ischemic stroke cannot be excluded and requires further study. 
 Free radicals generated from oxidation reactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Intracerebral adrenal medulla grafts have been used in human patients as an experimental treatment for Parkinson's disease, based on studies in animal models of this disorder. 
 GBR 12909 selectively blocks dopamine uptake and its biochemical and pharmacological profiles suggest that it may possess antidepressant activity and be of value in treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). 
It seems to mediate some of the effects of antipsychotic drugs and drugs used against Parkinson's disease, that were previously thought to interact only with D2 receptors. 
 The importance of the dopaminergic system in brain function has been emphasized by its association with neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
Alterations in the number or activity of these receptors may be a contributory factor in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are targets of drug therapy in many psychomotor disorders, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, and may also have a role in drug addiction and alcoholism. 
 The distribution of calbindin-D28K (CaBP)-positive neurons was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 4 controls, 5 cases of Parkinson's disease and a single case of strionigral degeneration. 
In Parkinson's disease and the case of strionigral degeneration, there was a relative sparing of the CaBP-positive neurons compared with CaBP-negative, pigmented neurons. 
These data imply that CaBP may confer some protection to SNC dopaminergic neurons against the pathological process which is responsible for Parkinson's disease and strionigral degeneration. 
 Ten patients were studied before and after autologous adrenal medullary transplantation to the central nervous system for Parkinson's disease to determine if the presence of new catecholamine-producing tissue near the hypothalamus would alter hypothalamic or pituitary function, mineralocorticoid levels, or catecholamine production. 
Similar findings have been reported in Parkinson's disease and in animal models. 
 The discovery of profound dopamine depletion of basal ganglia in patients with Parkinson's disease and the development of antiparkinsonian drug therapy were largely based on animal models. 
The behavioural changes caused by cholinergic drugs, reserpine and related agents, and unselective neuronal lesions were the first widely used animal models for Parkinson's disease. 
This Ungerstedt model still is one of the basic animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
The parkinsonism induced by the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in the mouse and the monkey is the latest and the best animal model for Parkinson's disease. 
Especially when given to the monkey, MPTP causes biochemical, behavioural and neuropathological changes which largely mimick those of Parkinson's disease in man. 
The MPTP-induced parkinsonism in the monkey can be used for the study of the neurobiology and new forms of drugs therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Recently, a new approach in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is to develop drugs which might prevent or retard the disease progression. 
The demonstrated toxicity of dopamine tends to support speculations that processes related to dopamine metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. 
We suggest that CCK-B receptor antagonists may be useful adjuncts to existing dopamine replacement therapy for improved management of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease arises from extensive premature loss of dopamine (DA)-utilizing midbrain neurons whose axons form the nigrostriatal pathway and densely innervate the striatum (caudate-putamen). 
The clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease are improved by treatment with DA receptor agonists, including apomorphine. 
 Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to primates produces many of the biochemical, morphological and behavioral changes that occur in Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study, concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in cortical regions surrounding the cingulate sulcus were assessed, and were found to be markedly decreased in symptomatic MPTP-treated vervet monkeys; these results parallel the cortical involvement in Parkinson's disease. 
 Forty-eight consecutive patients not taking dopamine antagonists and without Parkinson's disease referred to a psychogeriatric service with a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder were assessed for affective flattening using an objective rating scale. 
 The loss of midbrain dopamine in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by a matching loss in the dopamine transporter and a rise in the D1 and D2 receptor densities. 
The activity of CuZnSOD is increased in patients who suffer from Down's Syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and in Parkinson's disease. 
 Since the discovery of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism, it has been postulated that (a) MPTP-like toxin(s) such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) may induce Parkinson's disease. 
Our results support the hypothesis that (a) MPTP- or MPP(+)-like substance(s) may be responsible for the nigral degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 In patients affected by Parkinson's disease, and in the monkey model of this disease, visual defects have been shown using psychophysical and electrophysiological measures of spatial and temporal contrast sensitivity. 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with degeneration of the dopaminergic component of the nigrostriatal pathway. 
A comparable phenomenon can be observed in animal models of Parkinson's disease produced by the administration of the selective neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). 
In addition, it is suggested that glutamatergic antagonists may be valuable supplements in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The existence of a striatum-restricted putative G protein-coupled receptor is of major importance for the understanding of basal ganglia physiology and degenerative diseases pathogeny such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that aging mice are more sensitive to MPTP and show more widespread damage to the monoaminergic systems than young mice, suggesting that MPTP-treated aging mice provide a more useful model for studying anatomical and neurochemical characteristics of Parkinson's disease than young mice. 
Since these dopaminergic pathways have been implicated in the control of attention in animals, selective attention to visual stimuli was studied in eight patients with early Parkinson's disease (Stage I or II as defined by the Hoehn and Yahr Scale) and eight normal controls of comparable age, sex and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient. 
 We examined acetylcholinsterase (AChE) activity and choline levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 9 control subjects of corresponding age: 8 were untreated Parkinson's patients; 4 were treated with carbidopa-levodopa (100/1,000 mg/day) for 20 +/- 3 months; and 4 were treated with carbidopa-levodopa (110/1,100 mg/day) for 28 +/- 18 months plus amantadine (200 mg/day) for 16 +/- 8 months. 
AChE activity did not differ in Parkinson's disease patients as compared to control subjects. 
 A 54-year-old man with a 5-year history of Parkinson's disease was treated with and autograft of adrenal medulla into the right caudate nucleus and died 4 months after surgery. 
 We placed a 60-year-old man with Parkinson's disease and marked therapeutic response fluctuations on a continuous enteral infusion of levodopa. 
Pyridoxine has been reported to attenuate the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease and it is suggested that pyridoxine supplementation should be considered in psychiatric patients with drug-induced movement disorders including persistent Parkinsonism. 
Results from basic animal research and from the application of the procedure to patients with Parkinson's disease suggests that at least three different fundamental processes may mediate the functional effects of adrenal medulla grafts: (a) Adrenal medulla grafts may induce changes in the blood-brain barrier; (b) adrenal medulla grafts may induce an increase in serum DA; and (c) adrenal medulla grafts may have a trophic effect on the host brain. 
 Amantadine, a well-known antiviral agent, causing an increase in dopamine synthesis, release and the inhibition of re-uptake of noradrenaline and dopamine in central and peripheral catecholaminergic neurons, is successfully used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
We propose that an excitotoxic process mediated by L-DOPA or an acidic derivative such as 6-OH-DOPA might be responsible for degeneration of nigral neurons in Parkinson's disease or striatal neurons in Huntington's disease. 
These data may be useful in elucidating the mechanism(s) underlying the D1/D2 synergism observed in neurologically intact animals, as well as in understanding the action of drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We evaluated neurochemically, behaviorally, and neuropathologically the availability of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated C57 black (BL) mice as a model for Parkinson's disease. 
These results show the validity of the MPTP-treated C57 BL mice as a suitable model for parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease. 
 We recently demonstrated that when different drugs (mainly used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease) are administered in combination they interfere with the availability of bromocriptine in the brain of rats (striatum and hypothalamus). 
Other compounds were chosen on the basis of clinical or anecdotal evidence linking them to Parkinson's disease. 
 In an effort to improve the clinical signs of Parkinson's disease, we have implanted mesencephalic dopamine cells from a 7-week human embryo into the caudate and putamen of a 52-year-old man with Parkinson's disease. 
The woman and the patient with Parkinson's disease were unknown to each other. 
Walking speed on an all-day basis improved 17%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease of old age characterized by triad of akinesia, rigidity and tremor, reduction of dopamine (DA) content in the nigrostriatum, and severe degeneration of neuron in the substantia nigra. 
 MIF-1, a synthetic tripeptide with MSH-release inhibitory properties, has been reported to improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease, attenuate levodopa-related dyskinesias and diminish the dyskinetic movements of Tardive dyskinesia. 
More recently, MIF-1 has been reported partially to protect against the nigro-striatal dopamine depleting effects of MPTP in mice, raising the possibility that it may exert protective effects against the development of Parkinson's disease. 
There is evidence to suggest that MIF-1 increases nigro-striatal dopaminergic activity, but its ability to improve symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease, levodopa-related dyskinesias and Tardive dyskinesia cannot be explained solely on the basis of the drug's effect on striatal dopaminergic neurons. 
MIF-1 has been reported to potentiate the melanocyte-lightening effect of melatonin in rats and its effects in patients with Parkinson's disease and Tardive dyskinesia are associated with marked mood elevation. 
Considerable evidence implicates disturbances of brain dopamine function in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric and neurologic disorders, especially schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 
The pattern of MPTP-induced DA and HVA losses in the vervet monkey mesostriatal dopaminergic system may resemble postencephalitic Parkinson's disease more closely than idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 I studied the neuropsychiatric disorders occurring after overdose with manganese (Mn), which have been shown to be neurologically similar to Parkinson's disease. 
 Autologous transplantation of the adrenal gland has been attempted as a treatment for severe Parkinson's disease with limited success. 
 We investigated CSF levels of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), a recently discovered neuropeptide that allosterically modulates GABAergic transmission, in various neurodegenerative disorders with dementia (28 patients with Parkinson's disease, 10 with Alzheimer's disease, 7 with Huntington's chorea). 
In Parkinson's disease, the cytotoxic mechanism of Dopa and iron may involve the neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra abundant in iron and dopaminergic neurons. 
 Twenty patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (l-deprenyl) and placebo without levodopa (L-dopa) in a randomized double-blind clinical cross-over study to analyze relative importances of dopamine (DA) synthesis and metabolism. 
 Several epidemiological studies have indicated that there may be an inverse relationship between smoking and Parkinson's disease. 
 Spontaneous circadian fluctuations of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) often occur, with dysfunction typically less severe in the early morning than in the afternoon. 
 Transplantation of adrenal medulla into the caudate nucleus as treatment for Parkinson's disease was performed in eight patients. 
Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced dopaminergic functions and decreased blink rate. 
Conversely, decreased blinking (as is observed in patients with Parkinson's disease) could reflect a compensatory mechanism to increase light exposure, reduce melatonin production and ultimately increase dopamine functions. 
 When used to treat patients with Parkinson's disease pergolide acts at dopamine receptors in the corpus striatum to improve locomotor activity, reducing the tremor, gait disturbances, bradykinesia or akinesia and rigidity experienced by such patients. 
Thus, pergolide would appear to be at least as useful as other dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or lisuride for the management of patients with Parkinson's disease when administered in combination with levodopa. 
 A rodent model of Parkinson's disease, the 1-methyl-4-(2'-methylphenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treated mouse, was used to determine whether striatal dopamine levels recover following grafting adrenal medulla into the striatum. 
Moreover, these observations bear on mechanisms that may underlie the general recovery of motor disturbances reported in human Parkinson's disease patients who have received a striatal graft of adrenal tissue. 
When viewed with reports that certain 2-methyl-beta-carbolines show MPP+-like toxicity in vitro and in vivo, these studies support the proposal that a mammalian beta-carbolinium compound may be taken up by nigrostriatal neurons and provoke the neuronal degeneration underlying Parkinson's disease. 
Furthermore, the observations suggest that the loss of DA terminals due to the progression of Parkinson's disease may be importantly involved in the gradual loss of clinical efficacy of the drug during chronic treatment. 
 Neural transplantation can restore striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
It has now been shown that mesencephalic dopamine neurons, obtained from human fetuses of 8 to 9 weeks gestational age, can survive in the human brain and produce marked and sustained symptomatic relief in a patient severely affected with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Abnormalities of foot strike in idiopathic Parkinson's disease may be amenable to therapy: objective measurements may reveal response which is not clinically apparent. 
The effect on foot strike of substituting placebo for a morning dose of a levodopa/carbidopa combination was studied in a double-blind, cross-over trial in 14 patients, aged 64 to 88 years, with no overt fluctuations in control of their idiopathic Parkinson's disease in relation to dosing. 
It appears that some abnormalities of foot strike due to Parkinson's disease are reversible. 
Employing test conditions, designed to provoke abnormalities of foot strike, might be useful in screening for pre-clinical Parkinson's disease. 
 In a previous study, we demonstrated that patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism (MPTP-IP) had a pattern of cognitive change similar to that in nondemented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In five levodopa (L-dopa)-treated patients with Parkinson's disease with severe fluctuations of motor performance, plasma L-dopa as well as dopamine levels were measured during 2 days, first under optimal standard L-dopa with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (PDI) and then after a dose adjustment period using slow-release L-dopa/benserazide (Madopar HBS) in an open inpatient trial. 
 Carbidopa/levodopa remains the most potent drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
On the other hand, two studies have shown that selegiline might slow the progression of Parkinson's disease, independent of any direct effects on symptoms. 
The ability of milacemide to specifically inhibit MAO-B in the brain makes it a natural choice as adjuvant to l-dopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
These effects of MPTP on extrastriatal DA levels in the rhesus monkey are compared with DA and HVA changes in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease, and their possible contributory role for the production, by MPTP, of a permanent parkinsonian condition is discussed. 
In patients suffering from Parkinson's disease a remarkable decrease in biopterin content was found in the brain. 
Neurotoxin-induced impairment of biopterin synthesis is probably a pathogenetically important disorder at the initial stage of Parkinson's disease. 
 Neurochemical changes in cholinergic neurons in the striatum and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the midbrain, especially in the basal ganglia, have been examined following the intraperitoneal administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which is known to cause behavioral changes resembling those in Parkinson's disease due to the destruction of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons. 
 Cell lines in which tyrosine hydroxylase was introduced either by infection or transfection were used in grafting experiments in a rat model of Parkinson's disease obtained by unilateral lesion of the substantia nigra. 
We discuss the usefulness of engineered cell lines to address the fundamental issues in grafting experiments and more particularly in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Whether Parkinson's disease patients have been shown to have abnormal visual evoked cortical potentials (VEPs) to flash and pattern stimulation or not, is a matter widely discussed. 
The retina is rich in dopamine and together with previous animal and human studies, this suggests that the abnormal VEPs in Parkinson's disease patients may be due to a biochemical and electrophysiological disorder in the retina. 
This hypothesis has been examined by studying the flash VEPs, pattern VEPs and with light electroretinogram in 29 Parkinson's disease patients and matched control subjects. 
 Six patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease received single rising oral doses of the nonergot dopamine agonist CV 205-502 in an open experimental study. 
The delay of P100 peak latency of the VECP in patients with juvenile Parkinson's disease after cessation of L-dopa indicated the deficiency of dopamine in these patients, which in turn was considered as a clinical model of senescence. 
 The aim of this study was to determine whether there were differences in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease who demonstrated a long-duration response (LDR) to treatment with dopa and carbidopa and in patients who demonstrated only a short-duration response (SDR) to the drugs. 
Increased oxidative deamination could be caused by an increase in MAO activity as Parkinson's disease progresses or by the treatment with L-dopa. 
 The kinetics in brain of the dopamine reuptake blocking agent [11C]-(+)-nomifensine and the L-dopa analogue 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa were compared in 3 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and age-matched healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography. 
The reductions were considerably less than the decrease previously reported postmortem for striatal dopamine content in the basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
This indicates that a limiting factor for the utilization of exogenous levodopa in Parkinson's disease may be a reduced transport capacity for the amino acid into the dopaminergic terminals. 
 Ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations were rated for mood changes during discrete "off," "on," and "on with dyskinesia" periods. 
It is suggested that these results argue for multiple etiologies of depression in Parkinson's disease. 
The literature on dopamine and depression in Parkinson's disease is briefly reviewed and the opportunity provided by "on-off" phenomena to study the effect of dopamine on mood changes is discussed. 
 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a potent dopaminergic toxin that has been found to produce Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in humans and monkeys. 
 MPTP causes a Parkinson's disease-like syndrome in which the dopamine content of the nigrostriatal system decreases. 
 Microdialysis in the human brain has been performed for the first time during thalamotomy intended to relieve tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These findings agree with the clinical observations that scoliosis occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease and its direction is correlated with the side of the major signs and symptoms of parkinsonism. 
 The management of fluctuations in motor function complicating advanced Parkinson's disease with continuously administered dopaminomimetics was studied in 12 patients. 
These results suggest that changes in central dopaminergic mechanisms contributing to motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease can be modified by procedures that provide continuous dopamine replacement. 
Such an effect may be significant for clinical actions of ECT in affective disorders and, possibly, in Parkinson's disease. 
The other possible clinical indications (alcoholism, Parkinson's disease, instead of cysteamine) are discussed. 
 Catecholamine-producing cells were grafted in the caudate nucleus of model rats with hemi-Parkinson's disease--animals with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. 
 A computerized maze task was constructed that allowed only partial vision of the maze structure and produced measurements for separate analysis of cognitive processes described as impaired in Parkinson's disease. 
Eighteen patients suffering from mild Parkinson's disease and 18 individually matched normal controls were investigated. 
 To study the hypotensive effect of L-dopa in patients with Parkinson's disease on long-term L-dopa, the blood pressure (BP) was measured in 14 patients and 6 controls before 100 mg L-dopa plus decarboxylase inhibitor and for up to 180 min after dosing. 
 Parkinson's disease is a neurological condition associated with neuronal degeneration in the corpora nigra with a drop in the level of dopamine in the striatum. 
We report a case of pregnancy in a woman of 34 years of age who was suffering from severe Parkinson's disease treated with levodopa. 
We have assessed this case in the light of viewing the literature which confirms that there is no effect on the pregnancy or on the fetus although the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are made worse. 
 The recent studies on the chemical pathology of Parkinson's disease show selective increases of iron and lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione (GSH) oxidizing capacity in the substantia nigra (SN). 
Therapeutic use of iron chelators, with the ability of crossing the blood brain barrier, as agents for retarding the oxidative stress and Parkinson's disease is envisaged. 
 The degeneration of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons is considered to be a predominant pathogenetic factor of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with degeneration of the nigrostriatal bundle. 
The use of neural transplantation to replace damaged nerve cells in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, is promising based on our current knowledge. 
 The long term effects of a first line treatment with levodopa or bromocriptine were compared in 36 previously untreated patients with Parkinson's disease in a prospective randomized trial: 18 patients were treated with levodopa alone (mean dose: 485 +/- 71 mg daily) whereas 18 others received bromocriptine alone (mean dose: 55 +/- 6 mg daily) during 36 +/- 3 and 31 +/- 3 months respectively. 
These results suggest the potential value of relatively high doses of D2 dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine) in the first line treatment of Parkinson's disease: however, their use can be limited by their decrease of effectiveness after several years and/or the occurrence of severe neuropsychiatric side-effects. 
These studies in turn have revealed the usefulness of imaging the transporter, a measure of the presence of dopaminergic nerve terminals, as a potential diagnostic tool in Parkinson's disease. 
This restricted localisation mimics the major striatal dopamine D1 receptor localisation and is of major importance for the understanding of basal ganglia physiology and degenerative diseases pathogeny such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. 
These observations indicate the involvement of NMDA receptors in catalepsy, and suggest a potential clinical implication of NMDA-receptor antagonists in Parkinson's disease. 
 Dopamine uptake sites, labelled by 3 nM [3H]GBR 12935, were reduced by 28-34% in post-mortem Parkinson's diseased striata (n = 22) compared to control striata (n = 28). 
Both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are consistently elevated in Parkinson's diseased striata from patients who have not been medicated with L-dopa pre-mortem. 
 Striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding was studied in vivo with positron emission tomography in seven patients with early Parkinson's disease using [11C]-raclopride. 
Thus, this study demonstrates that there is denervation supersensitivity in dopamine D2 receptor binding in early Parkinson's disease. 
 Clinicians have long observed an anecdotal association of Parkinson's disease with stoic, industrious, and inflexible personality traits, both premorbidly and after the onset of motor symptoms. 
In this study, using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, we found significantly less novelty-seeking behavior (behavior thought to be dopamine-dependent) in Parkinson's disease patients than in matched controls, but no differences between groups in behaviors thought to be dependent on serotonin and norepinephrine. 
We discuss the literature and propose a mechanism that may explain the relationship between brain dopaminergic systems and personality in Parkinson's disease. 
These observations related to Parkinson's disease and to the clinical trial of deprenyl as an agent that may retard progression of the disease. 
 A 58 year-old man with a 4-year history of Parkinson's disease developed a myoclonic syndrome with photosensitivity. 
 The main objective of this study was to determine whether the activation of dopaminergic pathways through adrenal-caudate transplantation stimulates the production of the dopamine cyclic metabolite salsolinol in CSF of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Therefore they may give indications of disturbances in the peripheral metabolism of catecholamines, when measured in urine samples of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Ro 40-7592, combined with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors and L-DOPA (as in Madopar and Sinemet), will offer substantial advantages in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, i.e. 
Using the unilaterally dopamine-denervated rat model of Parkinson's disease, it was first shown that fetal substantia nigra grafts were effective and, later, that adult adrenal medullary chromaffin tissue might be used as a possible substitute for fetal brain tissue. 
These observations led to the first clinical trials with chromaffin autografting in severe cases of Parkinson's disease, which were initiated at the Karolinska Hospital in 1982, and several years later to clinical trials with grafts of fetal dopamine neuroblasts obtained after early elective abortions. 
Here, I shall review our recent studies of grafts and growth factors as they relate to possible new therapeutic principles applicable not only to Parkinson's disease, but also to Alzheimer's senile dementia and possibly to spinal cord injury and other afflictions. 
In accordance with these results: (1) the density of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites was reduced in the substantia nigra of a patient with Huntington's chorea, a disease associated with a degeneration of striatonigral neurons; (2) the density of [3H]SCH 23390 binding sites was unaffected in the substantia nigra of a patient with Parkinson's disease, a disorder characterized by a marked loss in nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons. 
 4-Propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine, or MK-458 (HPMC), a selective, nonergot D2 agonist administered orally twice a day in sustained-release form, was studied as adjunctive therapy with carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) in 12 Parkinson's disease patients with motor response fluctuations. 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with a massive loss in melanized dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in a severe striatal dopaminergic denervation. 
 A modified primate model of Parkinson's disease was developed to assess the effectiveness of various agents that act via dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin or glutamate systems. 
Finally, agents with potential therapeutic use in Parkinson's disease were also tested. 
These results indicate that Ro 40-7592 may improve the therapy with L-DOPA (plus decarboxylase inhibitor) of Parkinson's disease. 
 Long-term treatment of human Parkinson's disease with levodopa or dopamine agonists is often complicated by the appearance of abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) that are extremely difficult to control. 
In addition, ceruletide may be useful in the treatment of dyskinesia, and bromocriptine alone or in combination with L-dopa may be effective in Parkinson's disease without the development of dyskinesia. 
 Studies of the changes in brain neurotransmitter and neurotoxin receptors in Parkinson's disease now provide information about the state of many receptors. 
Such approaches are providing an increasingly important perspective on Parkinson's disease therapeutics and possible pathogenesis. 
 The technique of receptor autoradiography was used to study the distribution of neurotensin receptors in post mortem brain tissues from patients affected by Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and from age-matched controls. 
Significant receptor decreases were found in the substantia nigra, both pars compacta and reticulata, and in the putamen in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
In addition, significant decreases of neurotensin receptors were found in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and dorsal part of caudate head in patients with Parkinson's disease but not in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, indicating differential involvement of neurotensin receptors in these two neurological disorders. 
In addition, both in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy the decrement of striatal neurotensin binding sites was less than expected from the reported decrease of dopamine content in this nucleus, suggesting only partial localization of neurotensin receptors on mesostriatal dopaminergic projections. 
The failure to reverse clinical parkinsonian symptoms highlights the stage of infancy of neural implantation in Parkinson's disease. 
When killed, these animals showed none of the neurochemical or neuropathological changes that would be expected in ALS or Parkinson's disease. 
 A patient with severe end-stage Parkinson's disease and troublesome fluctuations in motor function was treated with a long-term intraventricular infusion of dopamine. 
 The latest improvements in Parkinson's disease therapy are reviewed with particular emphasis on the management of long-term treatment syndrome, which has become the chief problem for Parkinson patients since the introduction of levodopa. 
 CV 205-502 (CV) is a long-acting dopamine agonist with potent D2 and weak D1 activity, which has not as yet been tested in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We performed a dosage ranging and placebo crossover study in six patients to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of CV when used as an adjunct to Sinemet in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
CV is a promising drug for use in Parkinson's disease and further studies are indicated to test its long-term safety and efficacy. 
 A topographical immunocytochemical analysis was performed on the substantia nigra from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and striatonigral degeneration. 
Calcineurin immunoreactivity was densely distributed throughout the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. 
If some MPTP-like neurotoxins could be the cause of Parkinson's disease, some other factors such as immunological, neurotrophic, or genetic factors may work together with the putative neurotoxins during the process of aging. 
It lends further validity to the hypothesis that MPP+-like beta-carbolines may be endogenous causative agents in Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa combined with carbidopa (Sinemet) remains the most effective approach to the symptomatic relief of Parkinson's disease. 
It is thus tempting to speculate that the early and continuing treatment of Parkinson's disease with compounds providing a relatively constant level of central dopamine stimulation will preclude wearing-off phenomena and mitigate on-off fluctuations and severe dyskinesias. 
 The pharmacokinetics of Sinemet CR, a controlled-release formulation containing carbidopa and levodopa, were investigated in healthy young and elderly volunteers and in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Since the discovery of a significant depletion of acetylcholine in discrete areas of the brain of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease, attempts at symptomatic therapy have concentrated on acetylcholine supplementation, an approach that is based upon the efficacy of dopaminergic supplementation therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
Because they had noticed that alcoholism and Parkinson's disease rarely coexist, the authors undertook a study to confirm this fact and attempt to explain it by implicating salsolinol. 
The authors also found that urinary salsolinol was very low in untreated patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In contrast, an increase with the age at time of death was observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, although the density of [3H]TBZOH binding sites was subnormal. 
The binding of [3H]TBZOH in the caudate nucleus decreased exponentially with the duration of Parkinson's disease. 
The data suggest that (1) parkinsonian symptoms appear above a threshold degeneration state corresponding to 50% of the normal innervation at the age of 60, and (2) aging does not play a major role in the process of nigrostriatal neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease. 
 Striated anal sphincter function was studied electrophysiologically and radiologically in six patients with Parkinson's disease and chronic constipation. 
Melatonin has been reported to attenuate the rigidity and tremor of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is a common movement disorder caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the brain. 
 The dopamine depletion that is characteristic of Parkinson's disease has been hypothesized to result from the combination of environmentally induced subclinical damage to the substantia nigra and the age-related loss of additional nigral neurons. 
These results suggest a probable link between an immunological change and the changes in catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease results from the death of the dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). 
It was, therefore, natural to assume that replenishing dopamine in the striatum might be an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
In fact, the dopamine precursor L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), the current drug of choice for treatment of Parkinson's disease, is believed to exert its therapeutic effect by replenishing dopamine levels in the corpus striatum via enzymatic decarboxylation within the synaptic terminals of surviving nigrostriatal neurons (Hornykiewicz, 1974). 
Using a classic animal model for Parkinson's disease (rats with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the SN), we show that L-dopa is also converted to dopamine in significant amounts within the 6-OHDA-lesioned SN. 
This may have important implications for the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
Dopamine released from a polymer matrix through a semipermeable receptacle alleviates experimental parkinsonism in rats, suggesting that controlled intrastriatal release of DA from a polymer matrix may provide an alternative method for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
This model parallels the MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced hemiparkinsonian model in primates and more closely approximates the extent of neurodegeneration seen in human idiopathic Parkinson's disease than previous parkinsonian rat models. 
It is concluded that tremors in both the resting and postural positions are an integral part of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and that both tremors have a similar frequency and pharmacological responsiveness in the early phases of the disease. 
 In six patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), we have characterized the clinical responses and serum levels of DOPA and 3-O-methyldopa in response to continuous i.v., nasogastroduodenal (NGD), and oral (p.o.) administration of L-DOPA solution with concomitant suppression of peripheral decarboxylase activity by carbidopa. 
 In seven patients with Parkinson's disease with daily motor fluctuations, we found that the same subcutaneous apomorphine dose that improved motor function when given in the morning after a normal night without taking levodopa failed to turn patients "on" during afternoon and evening "off" periods, and on a different morning after receiving levodopa during the night. 
 Catecholamine concentrations were measured in tissue samples of caudate and adrenal medulla in eight patients with Parkinson's disease who were taking L-dopa and were undergoing autologous transplantation of adrenal medulla to caudate nucleus. 
 Transplantation of autologous adrenal medulla tissue into the striatum has recently been proposed as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 In this study, concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA), a principal metabolite of dopamine (DA), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 17 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who had been effectively treated with L-DOPA and in 8 patients clinically diagnosed as having striatonigral degeneration (SND) and for whom treatment with L-DOPA had proved ineffective. 
Thus, as in Parkinson's disease, central histaminergic systems appear to be spared in the MPTP model. 
In this study the subjects are 23 cases of ALS including 15 cases in Nara and Mie and 8 cases in other prefectures except in Kii peninsula, 14 cases with ataxia, 11 cases with other degenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, 25 cases of cerebrovascular disease as compared to 26 normal controls. 
6 cases (40%) with ALS in Nara and Mie have the value above the mean +2 standard deviation of controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Sebum secretion was measured on the foreheads of 47 unmedicated patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, aged 50-81 years and 80 healthy, matched volunteers. 
 By using stereotaxic surgical techniques, ventral mesencephalic tissues from aborted human fetuses of 8 to 10 weeks' gestational age were implanted unilaterally into the striata in two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Although our results support further scientific experimentation with transplantation in Parkinson's disease, widespread clinical trials with this procedure are probably not warranted at this time. 
Among the remaining 144 cases, the proportions of whites and blacks were similar, yet the frequency of Alzheimer's disease was 2.6 times higher among whites (P = 0.001), dementia due to Parkinson's disease was more frequent among whites (P = 0.05), and the frequencies of multi-infarct dementia and dementia due to chronic ethanol abuse were higher among blacks (P = 0.004 and P = 0.007, respectively). 
In contrast, in the globus pallidus total iron levels were decreased by 29% in Parkinson's disease. 
Total copper levels were reduced by 34-45% in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease; no difference was found in the other brain areas examined. 
Zinc levels were increased in substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease by 50-54%, and the zinc content of the caudate nucleus and lateral putamen was also raised by 18-35%. 
 Adrenal medullary catecholamines were measured in tissue samples from eight patients who underwent autologous transplantation of the adrenal medulla to the caudate nucleus as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. 
 The on-off phenomenon is an almost invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The primary pathological change in Parkinson's disease is the destruction of dopamine containing cells in the zona compacta of substantia nigra. 
Recent postmortem evidence in brain tissue from patients dying with Parkinson's disease also suggests the occurrence of some on-going toxic mechanism. 
These data suggest altered iron handling occurs in Parkinson's disease which may lead to the generation of toxic oxygen species such as superoxide radicals. 
There is also evidence for an inhibition of mitochondrial function in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
So there may be a close association between the actions of the synthetic neurotoxin MPTP and the underlying cause of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 The long term effects of a de novo treatment with levodopa versus bromocriptine were compared in respectively 13 and 15 previously untreated patients with Parkinson's disease in a prospective randomised trial. 
These results demonstrate the potential of D2 dopamine agonists (like bromocriptine) in the de novo treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, their use is limited by their lack of efficacy and/or the occurrence of neuropsychiatric side effects. 
These results question the hypothesis of an involvement of CCK in the regulation of dopaminergic neurons and help to explain the absence of decreased CCK levels in the caudate and putamen of Parkinson's disease victims. 
Thus, although tetrahydroisoquinoline and N-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline are not neurotoxic, it is conceivable that the chronic endogenous formation of quaternary species could cause neuronal lesions that contribute to the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

The tremor of Parkinson's disease occurs in resting and postural positions. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which the primary pathology is thought to be a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). 
MPTP in the human causes a severe irreversible state that very closely resembles idiopathic Parkinson's disease both in its clinical features and response to pharmacological treatment. 
Interest in potential environmental agents that might play a role in the aetiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is likely to increase as the result of the discovery of the relatively simple molecule MPTP which is highly toxic to the substantia nigra. 
Until the discovery of the neurotoxicity of MPTP there was no effective animal model of Parkinson's disease. 
The morphological and biochemical changes in the brains of the animals are more limited and selective than those seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The precise mechanism of MPTP toxicity has yet to be determined and may provide the clue to the mechanism of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease. 
There are potential applications of this technology to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. 
 The distribution and density of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were examined by autoradiography in postmortem brain tissue from patients with pathological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, status lacunaris, clinical parkinsonism without neuropathological lesions and in age-matched controls. 
No significant differences in the distribution or density of D1 or D2 receptors were found in Parkinson's disease in the areas examined, including the nucleus caudatus, putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. 
Patients clinically diagnosed as parkinsonians but without Parkinson's disease lesions or striatal lacunar softenings showed reduced densities of D2 receptors in the nucleus caudatus and putamen, while in the substantia nigra the densities were comparable to controls.

It has been argued, on theoretical grounds, that some drugs slow the progress of Parkinson's disease, although no firm evidence has supported this. 
The treatment of Parkinson's disease can be demanding, rewarding and sometimes frustrating, but it remains a most challenging exercise in pharmacotherapy. 
 The effect of a 2.5-fold increase in daily carbidopa intake on the bioavailability of levodopa was studied in six patients with Parkinson's disease on a low chronic regimen of carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) at the fixed ratio of 1:10. 
These findings provide further evidence of the prime role of central pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors in the pathogenesis of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
 We conducted a 20-week nonblind study to evaluate the efficacy of piribedil in 30 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 Marked fluctuations in mobility, known as the on-off phenomenon, frequently emerge during the course of chronic treatment with levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These observations indicate that the on-off phenomenon in our patient reflect the fluctuations of plasma levodopa levels as demonstrated in Parkinson's disease, but there may be substantial differences in levodopa transport across the blood-brain barrier and/or striatal dopamine-receptor interaction between Parkinson's disease and BH4 deficiency. 
 CQA 206-291, a new D2 dopamine receptor agonist with a biphasic dopaminergic profile, was given to six patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease after overnight drug withdrawal. 
This preparation thus could be an effective model for investigating the exacerbation of behavioral deficits produced by an increased demand placed upon a compromised DA system, as may occur in Parkinson's disease or with antipsychotic drug treatment. 
These results are discussed in terms of their support for the free radical hypothesis of Parkinson's disease and for the role of antioxidants in the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder. 
Given the implications of dopamine systems in certain neuropathological and psychotic disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia it is likely, as already suggested by some experimental evidence, that neurotensin plays an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases. 
 Two L-dopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease who developed distressing belching during "off" periods are reported.

 A pathological study of 21 patients with Parkinson's disease of asymmetrical onset revealed significant asymmetry of degeneration of the substantia nigra with greater neuronal loss contralateral to the initially affected body side. 
Serial motor evaluations in 20 patients with asymmetrical Parkinson's disease failed to reveal any such asymmetry of duration of motor response to levodopa. 
Transplantation studies in the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion rat model of Parkinson's disease were initiated in the late seventies. 
The results so far reported from trials using adrenal medullary grafts in patients with Parkinson's disease appear to conform to the available animal experimental data at least in two important respects: significant long-term graft survival has not been possible to document, and any clear-cut functional effects consistent with sustained graft-induced dopamine release have not been demonstrated. 
There is increasing experience with the use of adrenal medulla transplantation for Parkinson's disease and much less experience in foetal substantia nigra transplantation. 
Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is set apart from other Parkinsonian conditions by a specific interregional (caudate-putamen) as well as a subregional (rostral-caudal) pattern of striatal dopamine (DA) loss. 
 An accelerated loss of dopaminergic neurons with advancing age leads to Parkinson's disease. 
 Administration of the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, to primates produces an excellent behavioral model of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Unlike idiopathic, but similar to postencephalitic, Parkinson's disease, dopamine and homovanillic acid levels in caudate nucleus were not spared relative to putamen; in fact, in the asymptomatic group caudate nucleus dopamine and homovanillic acid concentrations were depleted to a greater extent than in putamen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  The meso-striatal dopamine neurons, essential for the automated control of movements, are primarily affected in patients with P.D.

 The effect of stimulation of cerebral dopamine D-1 receptors by CY 208-243 on motor disability was tested in MPTP-treated parkinsonian marmosets and patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Single morning doses of CY 208-243 (5-40 mg) were compared with the usual morning dose of levodopa in eight patients with Parkinson's disease on long-term levodopa therapy who had developed motor fluctuations from immobility with akinesia and rigidity (off) to mobility often with dyskinesias (on).

the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. 
 Response fluctuations in motor function, complicating long-term dopaminomimetic therapy of Parkinson's disease, may extend to the cognitive realm. 
These results support the view that slight changes in cognition are associated with dopaminomimetic therapy of Parkinson's disease, but that these changes may be task-specific. 
This change in D1 dopamine receptor morphochemistry is discussed in relation to the neurochemical deficits produced by dopaminergic denervation and in Parkinson's disease. 
 The method of compensation of dopamine (DA) deficit in the striatum by living, DA producing cells implanted into the brain, creates new hopes for patients with Parkinson's disease. 
This finding, together with the possible retardation of the progression of the disease with selegiline suggests that dopaminergic treatment in early Parkinson's disease should be initiated using a dopamine agonist such as lisuride in combination with selegiline and levodopa. 
 Selegiline 10 mg per day was compared to placebo as an adjunct to levodopa treatment in this double-blind study of early or moderately advanced Parkinson's disease. 
The results support the use of selegiline as an early adjunctive treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
Whether selegiline slows down the progression of Parkinson's disease needs further examination.

 Ten patients with Parkinson's disease and urinary symptoms underwent urodynamic assessments before and after subcutaneous administration of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. 
Although the effect on detrusor behaviour was variable, subcutaneous apomorphine may be of use in both the assessment and treatment of voiding dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) produces symptoms similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease in primates. 
 Using case-control methodology, we assessed prevalence and duration of exposure to putative risk factors for rapid progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients not taking levodopa or direct dopamine agonists. 
 Although epidemiological studies have suggested a lower incidence of Parkinson's disease in cigarette smokers, repeated exposure to cigarette smoke or nicotine does not protect against neurotoxicity induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 
[3H]GBR 12935 binding was decreased in the putamen and caudate nucleus of subjects with Parkinson's disease (33 and 46% of control values, respectively) and progressive supranuclear palsy (38 and 57% of control values, respectively). 
No significant differences were found between Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, or dementia with Parkinson's disease and controls. 
In non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease the levels of DBI were increased in a subgroup with depressive disturbances whereas no differences was observed in the non-depressed cases. 
 The leg muscle electromyographic responses induced during stance by impulsive displacements of a treadmill belt (directed forward or backward and at different rates) were studied in a group of patients with Parkinson's disease and a group of age-matched healthy subjects. 
This supports earlier findings of changes in intrinsic muscle stiffness in Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent reports of adrenal medullary autografts in patients with Parkinson's disease raise several important questions with respect to the cell types actually being transplanted as well as the potential for chromaffin cell banking prior to neural transplantation. 
No differences in plasma DOPA levels were found between normal children (0-15 yr, n = 60), normal adults (n = 39) and patients with essential hypertension (n = 40) or Parkinson's disease (no DOPA therapy, n = 30).

The data suggest a possible beneficial effect of OR-462 in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Previous short-term studies have shown that the dopamine agonist pergolide improves control of Parkinson's disease when used in conjunction with carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet). 
We assessed the long-term outcome (2 1/2- to 3-year follow-up) in patients with Parkinson's disease who participated in our previous pergolide double-blind trial and were subsequently switched to open-label pergolide therapy. 
We administered pergolide to patients with suboptimal control of Parkinson's disease who had a short-duration response to carbidopa-levodopa in a 6-month, double-blind study. 
In conclusion, patients with Parkinson's disease who experience clinical fluctuations with carbidopa-levodopa may be helped by the addition of pergolide to the therapeutic regimen. 
Of doubtful clinical importance, this might be attributed to decreased tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic activity and has also been seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.

 Questions arising from recent clinical neural transplantation trials in Parkinson's disease have under-scored the necessity for a thorough experimental evaluation of the structural and functional consequences of this procedure. 
Therefore the neuropeptide alterations previously reported in Parkinson's disease are probably not secondary to the severe lesion of dopaminergic neurones, but constitute another intrinsic feature of the disease. 
A number of epidemiological investigations have demonstrated that individuals who are or who have been smokers are less likely to develop idiopathic Parkinson's disease (a disorder involving a deficit in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotransmission). 
These individuals are thereby "protected" from the later development of Parkinson's disease. 
 The densities of D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors were measured with [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]spiperone, in the caudate nucleus and putamen of a large series of patients with Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy, in relation to markers of dopaminergic and cholinergic innervation of the striatum ([3H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding and choline acetyltransferase activity). 
In Parkinson's disease, the densities of both types of receptors were unchanged, whereas in PSP, the density of D2, but not D1-type dopamine receptors, was decreased in the caudate nucleus and the putamen. 
 The neuropathologic and pathophysiological relationship of specific to more generalized cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains incompletely understood. 
It is due to the decreased DA level and the enhancement of DA turnover that MPTP-treated mice became remarkably akinetic after stress, and that L-DOPA therapy is not effective when the symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease worsen due to stress. 
The major etiologic theory (dopamine [DA] supersensitivity hypothesis) suggests that TD is the pharmacologic opposite of Parkinson's disease and implies that all patients with TD should respond uniformly to specific pharmacologic agents. 
 In idiopathic Parkinson's disease massive cell death occurs in the dopamine-containing substantia nigra. 
Second, the estimated cell loss in these cell groups in Parkinson's disease is directly correlated (r = 0.97, P = 0.0057) with the percentage of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons normally present in them. 
This evidence suggests a selective vulnerability of the neuromelanin-pigmented subpopulation of dopamine-containing mesencephalic neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is likely to be caused by one or more unidentified neurotoxins, present in the environment or formed endogenously, which progressively damage dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons.

 Autografting of dopamine-producing adrenal medullary tissue to the striatal region of the brain is now being attempted in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Since the success of this neurosurgical approach to dopamine-replacement therapy may depend on the selection of the most appropriate subregion of the striatum for implantation, we examined the pattern and degree of dopamine loss in striatum obtained at autopsy from eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
We propose that the motor deficits that are a constant and characteristic feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease are for the most part a consequence of dopamine loss in the putamen, and that the dopamine-related caudate deficits (in "higher" cognitive functions) are, if present, less marked or restricted to discrete functions only. 
We conclude that the putamen--particularly its caudal portions--may be the most appropriate site for intrastriatal application of dopamine-producing autografts in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 A wide range of cognitive impairments can be observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
To test this hypothesis, a group of patients with Parkinson's disease were assessed both on and off levodopa treatment, on a range of tests selected from the human and animal experimental literature as being sensitive to disruption of prefrontal cortex. 
The results suggest that different areas of prefrontal cortex are involved in the tasks employed, and that functional levels of dopamine in separate areas of cortex and caudate may differ crucially in Parkinson's disease. 
 The rapid efficacy of amantadine on akinesia and rigidity in Parkinson's disease is generally known. 
 The effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin which selectively destroys the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and produces Parkinson's disease-like syndrome, on striatal dopamine receptors was determined in a mouse strain known to be very sensitive to the neurotoxic effect of MPTP.

 Loss of efficacy and response fluctuations develop in many patients with Parkinson's disease after long-term levodopa therapy. 
It was recently suggested that intracerebral grafting of fetal nigral or adrenal chromaffin cells may be beneficial in advanced Parkinson's disease by reestablishing spontaneous dopaminergic neurotransmission or by secretion of trophic factors that promote sprouting of residual dopaminergic nerve-terminals. 
This study demonstrates (1) that spatial frequency-dependent electrophysiological abnormalities occur in the MPTP-treated monkey, a result previously found in human Parkinson's disease, and (2) that dopamine has a specific function in neurotransmission in the visual system of primates. 
 The rotational model of Parkinson's disease has been widely used to investigate the action of dopamine agonists. 
Thus, administration of drugs which are therapeutically effective in Parkinson's disease, elicits circling behavior contralateral to the lesioned side.

 The effect of isoniazid on levodopa-induced dyskinesias has been evaluated in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease, following a serendipitous observation that choreic dyskinesias induced by levodopa in one parkinsonian patient were markedly reduced during treatment with isoniazid for tuberculous infection. 
The muscle sink for L-dopa may influence the plasma profile of the amino acid, which has implications for the therapeutic response to L-dopa in Parkinson's disease. 
 On-off fluctuations in longstanding Parkinson's disease initially respond well to a combined drug regime of Levodopa with direct dopamine agonists and L-deprenyl. 
 The continuous dopaminergic stimulation provided by infusion of dopamine agonist drugs, is a very effective strategy to control ON-OFF fluctuation in Parkinson's disease. 
 The experience that the supplementation of depleted dopamine in the nigro-striatal system of parkinsonian patients with L-dopa improves the clinical triad, akinesia, rigidity and tremor, mainly applies to long-term treatment in the early phase of Parkinson's disease. 
These results are discussed with respect to the advantage of the constant availability of lisuride at central dopamine receptors for the management of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease showing fluctuations in motor performance probably related to the kinetics of conventional oral therapy.

Intracerebral infusion of dopamine agonists may be a possible experimental alternative to the treatment of levodopa induced fluctuations in Parkinson's disease but stable and soluble dopamine agonists and suitable delivery systems are needed. 
 Attempts to reconstruct the damaged nigrostriatal pathway in experimental models of Parkinson's disease have thus far been carried out in animals with neurotoxically induced dopamine deficiency. 
 For many years, bromocriptine has proven to be a useful treatment for some of the disabling motor effects seen in Parkinson's disease. 
Changes in the ERG, VEPs and contrast sensitivity occur in Parkinsonian patients and are identical to those observed in animal models whose dopaminergic retinal system has been destroyed, thus suggesting a degenerative process of this system in Parkinson's disease. 
 A deficit of nigrostriatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease is well known. 
In untreated (naive or wash-out) men with Parkinson's disease, we studied TID function through basal and stimulated plasma levels of growth hormone, prolactin and thyrotropin. 
TID function is preserved in men with Parkinson's disease. 
 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) destroys nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways and thereby produces a syndrome similar to Parkinson's disease. 
 Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease, treated with levodopa for the past few years, concomitantly received 500 mg of cytidine diphosphate choline (CDPC) daily for 30 days. 
MPTP given in high doses induces Parkinson's disease-like syndrome and gastric ulcers. 
 Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for levodopa have been studied in relation to the pathogenesis of the motor fluctuations which complicate advanced Parkinson's disease. 
 Recent advances in drug delivery technology are creating novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa and dopamine agonists. 
This article reviews those technologies which can be applied to Parkinson's disease, both for targetting the central nervous system with drugs, as well as for matching the appropriate rate controlled delivery with therapeutic needs. 
Clinical investigations now in progress suggest that new technologies which deliver constant dopaminergic stimulation to patients with Parkinson's disease may not only eliminate the unpredictable swings in therapeutic efficacy in Parkinson patients with the "on/off" effect, but may even have a role in the future in preventing such fluctuations from developing in patients chronically treated with dopaminergic therapies. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease and possibly in patients with schizophrenia, prefrontal physiological activation during a cognitive task that appears to depend on prefrontal neural systems correlates positively with cognitive performance on the task and with clinical signs of dopaminergic function. 
 Four patients with Parkinson's disease and severe fluctuating responses to levodopa and oral dopamine agonists were treated with continuous administration of lisuride infusions, administered by means of an externally worn pump. 
The distribution and densities of dopamine receptors were examined in 12 cases of Parkinson's disease and compared to a control adult population. 
The reduced rate in Parkinson's disease seems to implicate the nigrostriatal system. 
A loss of the normal spatial-temporal relationships may also occur during L-DOPA therapy in Parkinson's disease. 
 The prevalence of overt dementia in 27 studies representing 4,336 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients was 39.9%. 
 The underlying cause of the long term complications of L-DOPA or dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease remains unknown. 
1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), after conversion to a toxic metabolite via the monoamine oxidase system, can induce Parkinson's disease by destroying dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in humans and primates. 
 Twenty patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor fluctuations received open-label amantadine (100-200 mg/d) in addition to their other antiparkinson medications. 
 Flicker sensitivity and spatial contrast sensitivity (CS) were examined in a total of 99 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In Parkinson's disease patients, however, the D1 receptor density was elevated, with values of 22.8 +/- 1.2 pmol/g (in patients not receiving L-DOPA) and 19.6 +/- 1.5 pmol/g (in patients receiving L-DOPA) compared to the age-matched control density of 16.0 +/- 0.4 pmol/g. 
In Parkinson's disease patients, the D2 densities were elevated in tissues from patients not receiving L-DOPA (19.9 +/- 1.5 pmol/g in putamen and 14.8 +/- 1.2 pmol/g in striatum) compared to the age-matched control values of 13.0 +/- 0.4 pmol/g and 12.6 +/- 0.3 pmol/g, respectively. 
These results support the hypothesis that the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine produces a clinical syndrome, indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease, via a selective destruction only of neurons with perikarya in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area. 
The findings that the peptidergic input to these cells together with most non-nigral dopaminergic cell groups are not damaged, indicate that the selectivity of the lesion produced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine appears greater than that seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The second patient is a 61-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, dementia, depression and L-dopa-induced oro-lingual-facial dyskinesias. 
Three groups of neurologically impaired subjects (with aphasia, right hemisphere damage, and Parkinson's disease) were administered tests to elicit each category of perseveration. 
This may explain why chronic treatment with bromocriptine has a lesser tendency to induce dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The response to continuous intravenous infusion of levodopa was evaluated in 23 patients with Parkinson's disease complicated by motor fluctuations. 
 A total of 22 patients suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 20 age-matched volunteers were questioned about autonomic disturbances and all underwent four non-invasive tests examining cardiovascular reflexes. 
On the other hand, the heart rate variation evoked by deep breathing as well as the blood pressure response and the heart rate response to sustained isometric exercise were significantly diminished in the patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
A dose-dependent and often complete blockade of all three signs was obtained with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (10:1) as well as with other classes of pharmacological agents that are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, i.e. 
 Ten patients with Parkinson's disease performed a simple reaction time task in which, on hearing a tone, they pressed a button with the left thumb. 
Parkinson's disease patients lost this advantage even when they were not performing a second task. 
The behavioural consequences of this may be that Parkinson's disease patients always perform as if they were carrying out another task at the same time. 
Long-acting propranolol is a useful adjuvant therapy for the tremors associated with Parkinson's disease. 
Accordingly, REM SD was performed on rats with an experimental model of Parkinson's disease. 
These data of improvement of two parameters of an experimental model of Parkinson's disease suggest that SD may be useful in this condition. 
 Of the neurological disorders, none can claim a battery of therapeutic agents based upon as rational a pharmacology as can Parkinson's disease. 
It has a short elimination half-life and, as Parkinson's disease progresses, the brain loses its capacity to store the drug and becomes dependent in a moment-to-moment fashion on plasma levodopa concentrations, creating therapeutic response fluctuations in over 50% of patients. 
These results suggest that gamma-Glu-DOPA may be applicable to the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 [3H]Spiperone binding to lymphocytes in Parkinson's disease (PD), Wilson's disease (WD), and age-matched control groups was studied. 
 Eleven patients with severe Parkinson's disease and on-off-phenomena were included in a controlled double-blind study on the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). 
To investigate the consequences of grafting adrenal medullary tissue into the brain of a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, a piece of adult mouse adrenal medulla was grafted unilaterally into mouse striatum 1 week after MPTP treatment. 
This effect may be relevant to the symptomatic recovery in Parkinson's disease patients who have received adrenal medullary grafts. 
 Complex motor fluctuations and dyskinesias ("on-off" phenomenon) in Parkinson's disease can be corrected by parenteral administration of levodopa, levodopa-methyl-ester, lisuride and apomorphine. 
Subcutaneous apomorphine infusion is unlikely to become a standard therapeutic procedure in Parkinson's disease, but it is a very valuable research method to gain further insight into the pathophysiology of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
 Levodopa is currently used at all stages of Parkinson's disease, particularly from Stage 3 onward. 
The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. 
 We found a causal relationship between variation in plasma dopamine level and memory impairment in Parkinson's disease. 
The specific binding of [3H]GBR-12935 to membranes prepared from the caudate nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease is decreased compared to membranes prepared from age- and sex-matched controls. 
 It is postulated that endogenous oxidative mechanisms are a major factor in the continuing death of dopaminergic neurons and the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
Firm supportive evidence is obtained from the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor experience which demonstrated a block of the toxicity of MPTP in animals and probable prolongation of the course of human Parkinson's disease. 
 Since the initiation of bromocriptine therapy for Parkinson's disease several newer dopamine agonists have been developed. 
These agents may be particularly effective in the early treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Quinpirole hydrochloride, a putative dopamine agonist, was investigated in animal models of central dopaminergic activity, to evaluate its possible role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Quinpirole differs from other dopaminergic drugs and may be useful for the therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
In established clinical Parkinson's disease the rostrocaudal gradient becomes steep; the putamen is more damaged. 
It can also damage ventral tegmental dopamine neurones and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, both of which may be affected in Parkinson's disease. 
 Human manganese poisoning or manganism results in damage to the substantia nigra of the brain stem, a drop in the level of the inhibitory neurotransmitter dopamine, and symptoms resembling those of Parkinson's disease. 
This might facilitate the development of effective compounds to control the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and perhaps prevent the induction of debilitating side effects. 
This finding suggests that (+)-AJ-76 might be of value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease, striatal dopamine D-2 receptors are elevated in patients that have not received L-DOPA therapy. 
In the SN of patients with Parkinson's disease, there is reduced binding of somatostatin, neurotensin, mu and kappa opiates, benzodiazepine and GABA and glycine. 
 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration is able to produce nigrostriatal damage and motor disabilities in primates similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease. 
 Persistent behavioural effect of the direct dopamine receptors agonist apomorphine in the rotational model of Parkinson's disease was investigated. 
 A quantitative analysis of unpredictable saccadic and smooth pursuit ocular motor and manual tracking was performed in 15 mildly affected, previously untreated subjects suffering from Parkinson's disease and in age-matched normal controls. 
It is postulated that the ocular motor changes seen in Parkinson's disease are contingent upon functional dopamine levels in the basal ganglia. 
 In an effort to study the interaction of pregnancy and Parkinson's disease (PD), I interviewed 18 women who had had a total of 24 pregnancies after onset of PD symptoms. 
Acute animal models thus produced closely resemble Parkinson's disease. 
Marked increase of locomotor activity was observed in MPTP treated mice after L-DOPA administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  Parkinson's disease generally responds well to dopaminergic therapy, but there is no unanimity concerning the optimal time for introducing dopaminergic medication. 
In Parkinson's disease the loss of dopamine innervation and the use of chronic administration of L-DOPA or therapy with dopamine agonists also affects the function of dopamine receptors in brain. 
This drug has been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of Parkinson's disease since it allows the dose of L-dopa to be reduced by approximately 25%. 
More important, selegiline may slow the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons that is characteristic of Parkinson's disease. 
Loss of nigrostriatal dopamine is now widely recognized as being directly related to the motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. 
These data suggest that the effects of MPTP are not as selective as originally thought and, more importantly, indicate that MPTP-induced parkinsonism in the primate may be more analogous to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, where cells other than SNc cells are affected. 
Since PSP and Parkinson's disease are both characterized by a severe dopamine nigrostriatal deficit, these results suggest that the decreased brain peptide concentrations found in Parkinson's disease do not simply result from a dopaminergic neuronal loss. 
 Exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) reproduces certain clinical, pathological, and neurochemical features of Parkinson's disease. 
 Ciladopa is a partial dopamine agonist that is effective in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who are no longer satisfactorily responding to levodopa. 
 Lisuride, a semisynthetic dopaminergic ergot derivative, was administered in 34 patients with Parkinson's disease (mean age 67.5 years, average duration of illness 7.1 years, mostly stage IV) in an average oral dosage of 1.2 to 1.5 mg (range 0.4 to 3.0 mg) in addition to basic treatment with levodopa and decarboxylase inhibitor. 
The dopamine content of the hypothalamus is considerably reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Seventeen hitherto untreated patients with mild Parkinson's disease were given the dopamine agonists mesulergine or pergolide. 
These pharmacologic properties differ from those of other antiparkinsonian agents; terguride may be effective for the chronic treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 A group of 24 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with normal fundi and normal visual acuities was examined electrophysiologically. 
It appears unlikely that any of these 4 MPTP analogues causes idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Using an electronic turn counter, we demonstrated that, like unilaterally lesioned rats, and without being aware of it, five ambulating outpatients with hemi-Parkinson's disease exhibit spontaneous rotation toward the hemisphere containing less striatal dopaminergic activity. 
 In this study, the 24-hour pattern of blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and urinary catecholamine (CA) excretion and the response of BP and plasma CA to the tilt test have been investigated in 13 untreated patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) and in 11 age-matched healthy controls. 
Although some contended it was merely a variant of Parkinson's disease, a specific electron microscopic finding of straight, rather than twisted, filaments in the neurofibrillary tangles established PSP as a distinct entity. 
The observed melanin affinity may contribute to the application of this compound for the treatment of Parkinson's disease or may play a role in its protective effect against MPTP neurotoxicity. 
Based on these findings, we postulate a central role for the brainstem peroxidase in dopamine metabolism as well as in the biochemical and anatomical changes associated with Parkinson's disease. 
 Bereitschaftspotentials (BPs) prior to extension movements of the index finger were studied in normal subjects and in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
For patients with Parkinson's disease there was no correlation between the change in their peak BP negativity (N1) after L-DOPA and their change in clinical mobility; in addition, there was no difference in the peak BP negativity of patients OFF therapy and that of age-matched normals, though there was a slight decrease in the amplitude of the early part of the BP for the patients with Parkinson's disease; this was the same part that had been enlarged by L-DOPA therapy. 
These findings suggest that the N1 is not affected by Parkinson's disease and that the effect of dopaminergic drugs on the N1 is mediated by actions on dopaminergic mechanisms elsewhere than in the striatum, perhaps in the cerebral cortex itself. 
The effect of L-DOPA will need to be taken into account in subsequent studies of the BP in Parkinson's disease. 
 Epidemiological surveys have repeatedly shown that idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs less frequently in persons who have smoked cigarettes for many years than among age-matched non-smokers. 
These observations could be of clinical interest in view of the lower incidence of cigarette smoking among Parkinson's disease patients, and the fact that 4PP is known to be present in cigarettes. 
 We are currently developing amino-substituted MPTP analogues as useful probes for understanding the mechanism of MPTP toxicity and Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is an illness with neuropathological and neuroanatomical abnormalities in many areas of the central nervous system. 
Recent studies in animal models of Parkinson's disease demonstrate that the loss of dopamine and many clinical manifestations of dopamine reduction can be reversed by transplantation of fetal dopamine-containing cells to specific dopamine-depleted areas of the brain. 
The author suggests that the transplantation of dopamine neurons, even across species barriers, is a reasonable consideration for the treatment of human Parkinson's disease. 
 Primary sensory symptoms occur in approximately 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The possible contribution of the hypothalamus with its connections to descending midbrain structures and the spinal cord to the etiology of primary sensory symptoms in Parkinson's disease are discussed. 
 Dopaminergic receptor properties in the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's chorea (HD) were studied by positron emission tomography (PET), using 11C-N-methyl-spiperone as a dopamine D2 receptor ligand. 
 The underlying mechanisms responsible for advanced Parkinson's disease's becoming refractory to dopamimetic therapies are unclear. 
Postmortem brain studies indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease have decreased basal ganglia gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function in addition to profound striatal dopamine (DA) deficiencies. 
Our results suggest that low doses of certain GABA mimetics will improve the responses of patients with Parkinson's disease to concurrent DA receptor agonist therapy. 
 Disorders of neurotransmitter balance are observed in Parkinson's disease, pharmacotoxic psychosis and depression. 
This iron compound improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease to almost the same extent as L-dopa. 
The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. 
Affected individuals exhibit all symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease. 
Understanding the mechanism of MPTP toxicity has also provided suggestions on how to treat the cause of Parkinson's disease. 
 In 13 patients with Parkinson's disease and "on-off" fluctuations and in a control group, the electrically evoked blink (R1 and R2 component) and corneal reflexes (CR), the habituation of the glabellar reflex, and the blink rate were studied. 
The shorter latency of CR, but not of R2, both in "on" and "off" patients, may suggest that in Parkinson's disease basal ganglia exert a different control of incoming sensory input transmitted via beta and delta fibers. 
 An apparent inverse relationship between smoking and Parkinson's disease prompted an investigation of the effect of chronic nicotine administration on dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors in rat brain. 
Most human studies come from the clinical literature relating to schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and attention deficit disorder. 
 The combinations of benserazide and levodopa (1:4, Madopar) and of carbidopa and levodopa (1:10 and 1:4, Sinemet) are currently the most effective treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The reason for this tachyphylaxis or declining efficacy in levodopa therapy and the increasing number and intensity of various distressing difficulties in the management of Parkinson's disease, such as dyskinesias and on-off phenomena, is the main subject of many recent studies. 
It is still widely accepted that levodopa provides the best therapeutic tool for Parkinson's disease. 
Bromocriptine, an ergot derivative, is the main clinically used dopamine agonist, and it has been established as a valuable adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Finally, the clinical relevance of this work is discussed and the potential use of selective D1 receptor agonists and antagonists in the treatment of psychotic states and Parkinson's disease is considered. 
To evaluate the potential of D-1 receptor stimulation in neurologic disease, SKF 38393, a selective D-1 dopamine receptor agonist, was administered to seven patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease in a double-blind, placebo controlled study. 
The results support the view that the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease may relate exclusively to the D-2 subclass of dopamine receptors. 
Intracerebroventricular infusion of PHNO may be an alternative experimental approach to untreatable motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. 
PHNO differs from other dopaminergic drugs and may be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We studied the effect of intracerebroventricular infusion of dopamine and dopamine agonists in rat and primate models of Parkinson's disease as an experimental approach to the treatment of levodopa-induced fluctuations. 
(+)-PHNO is a potent dopamine agonist drug of potential use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
It is suggested that either tetrahydroisoquinoline or N-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline, which is a DA-related pyridinium compound, could be one of the environmental or endogenous compounds inducing Parkinson's disease. 
In control animals these lesions depleted striatal dopamine, producing rigidity, poverty of movement and abnormal posture comparable to Parkinson's disease in the human; cessation of feeding and drinking led to progressive weight loss and death. 
 In Parkinson's disease the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons leads to striatal dopamine deficiency and correlates with the severity of parkinsonian disability. 
With the exception of the association between cortical somatostatin deficiency and intellectual deterioration, the role of the neuropeptides in the pathophysiology and clinical features of Parkinson's disease are not yet fully understood. 
This could be of major importance in the pathophysiology of motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
 Mean levels of the two hydrolases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the dopamine metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and total protein concentration were examined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a group of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type, a group of comparably demented patients with Parkinson's disease, and a neurologically healthy elderly control group. 
Unlike the Parkinson's disease group, whose mean concentration of HVA was lower than, but not significantly different from that of the control group, the mean HVA concentration of the Alzheimer's disease group was significantly elevated. 
Independent of CSF protein concentration, ACE activity per milliliter exhibited a positive correlation with AChE activity per milliliter within the control and Parkinson's disease groups, whereas a statistically significant correlation for these CSF hydrolases was not observed within the Alzheimer's disease group. 
Thus, the CSF profiles for patients with mild dementias associated with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease differed by at least two neurochemical criteria. 
Based on the levels of ACE activity, DOPAC, and HVA per milliliter of CSF, two discriminant functions were derived and resulted in the correct classification of 71% of all subjects (n = 38) into Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and neurologically healthy control groups. 
It is concluded that the property of B-HT 920 to stimulate the 'denervated' supersensitive (reserpine, 6-OH-dopamine, MPTP) but not the normosensitive postsynaptic dopamine receptor in the striatum may represent a novel principle for a specific approach to dopamine substitution treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 We had previously reported that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which produces Parkinson's disease in humans and animals, inhibited tyrosine hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis, in striatal tissue slices after its conversion to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion by monoamine oxidase. 
N-methylisoquinolinium ion could be one of the candidates of endogenous or environmental factors that produce Parkinson's disease. 
 The neurotoxin N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) can induce degeneration of dopamine (DA) and other central monoamine neurons, leading to Parkinson's disease-like effects in man, monkey, and mouse. 
 Parkinson's disease patients have been shown to have abnormal visually evoked cortical potentials (VEPs) to pattern stimulation. 
Whereas dopamine is not an important neurotransmitter in the central visual pathways, the retina is rich in dopamine and, together with previous animal and human studies, this suggests that the abnormal VEPs in Parkinson's disease patients may be due to a biochemical and electrophysiological disorder in the retina. 
This hypothesis has been examined by studying the VEPs and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) of Parkinson's disease patients and matched control subjects. 
The amplitudes of the cortical and retinal evoked potentials were significantly reduced in Parkinson's disease patients compared with the control subjects and this could not be attributed to any particular feature of the disease or its treatment. 
These findings suggest that the abnormality of the VEP in Parkinson's disease patients is, at least in part, secondary to an abnormality of the retina itself. 
 Intravenous administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6,-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) leads to the progressive development of a model of Parkinson's disease in the primate. 
 Bromocriptine (2-Br-alpha-ergocryptine), a partial ergoline derivative, is a dopamine agonist which has been used successfully in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly and Parkinson's disease. 
The findings are analogous to deficits in Parkinson's disease and suggest a behavioral mechanism that might account for much of the rate attenuating effects of neuroleptics. 
 This study investigates the hypothesis that, as a consequence of Parkinson's disease, disturbed caudate outflow will lead to deficits in cognitive functions dependent upon the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, the cortical focus of caudatofugal signals. 
Since Parkinson's disease also involves lesions in extra-striatal midbrain cells which reduce the extrinsic supply of dopamine to this cortical region, such functions are at double risk. 
The detection of VEP abnormalities in Parkinson's disease was dependent on the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus (a vertical square wave grating). 
VEP latency did not correlate with the major clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease and could not predict the results of chronic dopaminergic therapy. 
 C57 black mice were injected repeatedly with maximal tolerated doses of 4 different chemical analogues of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), or its metabolite N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), in order to assess their possible neurotoxicity for dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons and their potential for causing idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 The effects of the putative dopamine agonist, ciladopa hydrochloride (AY 27,110) a non-ergot compound, were investigated in animal models of dopaminergic activity to evaluate its possible role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Ciladopa differs from other available dopaminergic drugs and may possess therapeutic advantages for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and clinical presentation, and clinical management of Parkinson's disease are reviewed. 
The cause of Parkinson's disease, a progressive, degenerative neurologic motor disorder, is unknown. 
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on the clinical presentation of the patient, which initially includes sensory complaints of aching pains, paresthesias, numbness, and coldness. 
Drug therapy is the cornerstone of clinical management of Parkinson's disease, but no treatment has been found that will retard or reverse the disease. 
Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist useful in treating Parkinson's disease. 
Drug therapy has improved greatly the functional ability of patients with Parkinson's disease, but new agents that can extend the length of effective treatment or reverse the disease are needed. 
Domperidone has been approved for use in Canada for the symptomatic management of upper gastrointestinal tract motility disorders and to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of dopamine agonist agents in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized especially by a degeneration of pigmented brain regions, like substantia nigra. 
It is the hope that this new model, which is described here in detail, will lead to decisive data underlying the cause of Parkinson's disease. 
As regards the subtypes of Parkinson's disease, the frequency of depressive states is significantly higher in the type dominated by akinesia and rigidity than in the type dominated by tremor. 
They suggest that if natural Parkinson's disease is caused by an MPTP-like neurotoxin, early treatment with antioxidants is unlikely to protect nigrostriatal neurons and prevent disease progression. 
 To investigate the possible alterations of spinal cord monoaminergic pathways in Parkinson's disease, the levels of dopamine, homovanillic acid, noradrenaline, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid have been measured in different subregions of the lumbar spinal cord in control subjects and parkinsonian patients. 
These data suggest that lumbar spinal cord noradrenergic and serotonergic, but not dopaminergic, systems are damaged in Parkinson's disease. 
These findings may, in part, explain the long-term clinical efficacy of bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 L-[18F] fluorodopa was administered in trace amounts intravenously to healthy control subjects and to patients with Parkinson's disease. 
This may reflect a reduction of striatal dopamine storage in Parkinson's disease. 
In nigral specimens taken from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, substantial reductions in somatostatin, neurotensin, mu-opiate and kappa-opiate receptors contrast with more modest reductions in dopamine and benzodiazepine I receptor subtypes. 
This animal hemiparkinsonian model will be useful in studies of volitional movement control, drug treatments of Parkinson's disease, and functional efficacy of brain tissue implants. 
 We examined the degree of binding of the calcium antagonist, [3H]nitrendipine ([3H]NDP), in the prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum and substantia nigra obtained at autopsy from patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Thus, it is highly likely that calcium channel antagonist binding sites on nigral dopamine (DA) neurons may be lost in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease. 
Physostigmine is contra-indicated in patients having symptoms and signs similar to those of Parkinson's disease, and the dose of physostigmine should also be reduced to 0.5 mg i.v. 
 We measured the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid, and o-phosphoethanolamine in autopsied brain of 9 patients who died with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 10 control subjects. 
When compared with controls, GABA concentrations in Parkinson's disease striatum were generally elevated. 
Striatal glutamic acid levels were markedly elevated in 3 of the 9 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Thirteen drug-free and not severely affected patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease underwent an insulin-hypoglycaemia test, a TRH test and a levodopa test. 
A comparison of the control case with a model of Parkinson's disease shows a shift of eigenvalues towards zero in the diseased state. 
 Among 49 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease, 40% were depressed according to DSM-III; they had major depression or dysthymic disorder accompanied by sleep disturbance, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, loss of self-esteem, and excessive guilt. 
On the basis of its very potent in vivo central D-2 dopamine receptor activities and its in vitro selectivity, N-0500, being the most potent compound within the series, is a much more specifically acting drug than many of the dopaminergic ergolines and might therefore be a good candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative illness which affects a significant number of the older population. 
The diminished clinical response in the final stages of Parkinson's disease is not due to receptor dropout, and must depend on other factors. 
 Systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is toxic to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and produces a syndrome similar to Parkinson's disease. 
 Striatal particulate preparations, both from rats with lesion-induced striatal dopamine (DA) loss and from some striatal dopamine (DA) loss and from some patients with Parkinson's disease, exhibit increased 3H-neuroleptic binding, which is interpreted to be the mechanism of denervation-induced behavioral supersensitivity to dopaminergic compounds. 
 The efficacy and tolerance of treatment with an 8-alpha-amino-ergoline derivative CU32-o85, Mesulergine, were compared with levodopa/benserazide (Madopar) in a 3 month double-blind controlled trial in 31 patients with Parkinson's disease, not previously treated with levodopa. 
It is suggested that Mesulergine derivatives might well be of value in future treatment of early Parkinson's disease and of late incompensated stages. 
The results of this study suggest that in an animal model for Parkinson's disease, MPTP interrupts the dopamine (DA) transmission by chemically denervating the nigrostriatal neurons and through a compensatory mechanism, it increases the number of DA receptors as well as the sensitivity of protein phosphorylation to calcium plus calmodulin in mouse striatum. 
Our findings suggest that the MPTP-induced model of Parkinson's disease may be due to a disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in dopamine neurons. 
These data indicate that the alterations of dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors may be different in parkinsonian and in manganese-intoxicated patients and that current therapy used for Parkinson's disease could be a hazard in treating manganese poisoning. 
 In experimental Parkinson's disease, we studied the effects of chronic administration (30 days), withdrawal, and reinstitution of bromocriptine. 
 In 64 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the basal level of prolactin (PRL) was normal. 
The results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms of epilepsy and of selective neuronal losses in diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
(+)-3-PPP may potentially be of use as a post-synaptic dopamine agonist drug in Parkinson's disease. 
Monotherapy with trihexiphenidyl or carbidopa-levodopa should be the initial treatment for the tremor of Parkinson's disease. 
 A patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and "on-off" phenomena is described. 
These results demonstrated for the first time that MPTP can cause long-lasting deficits in nigrostriatal functioning in the cat and may provide a means for studying the apparently selective neurotoxic effects of MPTP as well as for understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. 
The striatal response in animals to isolated loss of dopamine innervation is an increase in glutamate decarboxylase activity, not the decrease frequently found in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
For these reasons, enhancement of basal ganglia GABA function may improve responsiveness to dopamimetic therapies in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
PC-12 cells provide a model catecholamine cell culture for screening environmentally occurring substances that may be relevant in the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
In this study, marmosets developed features typical of Parkinson's disease following treatment with MPTP for four days. 
The effects of MPTP treatment on the concentrations of dopamine and neuropeptides were determined and changes compared with those reported for Parkinson's disease. 
These neuropeptide changes in the CNS contrast with those reported for Parkinson's disease. 
In view of the autonomic dysfunction associated with Parkinson's disease, peripheral concentrations of neuropeptides were determined. 
The simultaneous elevation of dopamine release and suppression of acetylcholine release may prove useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Seventeen lisuride infusions were given to 12 patients with Parkinson's disease who showed daily oscillations in motor performance. 
 Treatment of Parkinson's disease is not difficult in the early stages of the disease; a therapeutic regimen of carbidopa-levodopa or possibly, a combination of carbidopa-levodopa and bromocriptine, provides the best therapeutic results. 
 The long-term effects of mesulergine, a new drug with dopamine agonistic properties, were studied in 28 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These results indicate that human fetal mesencephalic tissue may be an efficient source of dopamine neurons for functional intracerebral grafting in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 The therapeutic effects of lisuride hydrogen maleate, a central dopamine agonist, were examined in 15 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease no longer satisfactorily responding to levodopa. 
A significant improvement (p less than 0.01) in the total Parkinson's disease disability score was obtained by the addition of lisuride to levodopa therapy. 
It is concluded from this study that lisuride is a valuable tool in the management of advanced Parkinson's disease that allows for a reduction of the side effects of levodopa therapy in the long-term treatment of the disease. 
The experimental model is useful to study the pathogenesis and possibly therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease. 
Anatomo-functional correlations can be presently outlined for most dopamine-containing networks, and anatomo-clinical studies indicate that they are globally affected in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
 Fluctuations in motor performances are the major problem in the longterm management of Parkinson's disease. 
 In the past decade, dopamine agonists have emerged as important treatment options for patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Five ergoline dopamine agonists--bromocriptine, lergotrile, pergolide, lisuride, mesulergine, and the nonergoline agonist, ciladopa--have undergone clinical trials in Parkinson's disease. 
In 10 years, we treated a total of 278 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, a declining response to levodopa, and diurnal oscillations in performance with five ergoline dopamine agonists (in addition to levodopa). 
Many of the patients so treated had mild or moderate Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease seems to be a kind of selective, highly accelerated 'premature aging' of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and the DA content of this neuron system shrinks within a short time to less than 10% of the normal level in the premorbid state. 
The striatum taken from a rat pretreated with 6-OH dopamine is a useful experimental model for the rapid screening of compounds with potential therapeutic benefit in Parkinson's disease. 
The effect of deprenyl is due, on the one hand, to the inhibition of MAO-B and, on the other hand, to inhibition of the uptake of dopamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  The selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitor has proven to be a useful adjunct to L-dopa therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
This exciting data, if confirmed in other long term clinical trials, may herald a new approach for the treatment of this degenerative disease, since more recent studies indicate that Parkinson's disease may eventually turn out to be a neurotoxic event (see Snyder and D'Amato, 1986, for review). 
 The classical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using L-dopa plus a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (DI) often leads after 3-5 years to the onset of the so-called long-term L-dopa syndrome (LTS). 
 Idiopathic Parkinson's disease may derive from the action of an environmental 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-like compound. 
There is preliminary evidence that this drug can interrupt the pathological process in Parkinson's disease and prolong life expectancy. 
The possibility that molecules with a similar action to MPTP cause idiopathic Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
Nevertheless, the nature and profile of neurotoxicity effected by MPTP and, in particular, MPP+ should ensure continuing analyses of the relevance of such action to an understanding of the etiology of, treatment of, and even the possible prevention of Parkinson's disease in man. 
Administration of MPTP to animals results in the production of a partial model of idiopathic Parkinson's disease as it occurs in man. 
MPTP treatment produces the major symptoms of Parkinson's disease in primates but the pathology is limited to the nigro-striatal system, whereas in Parkinson's disease pathology is more widespread. 
These observations are discussed in reference to the rodent-MPTP model of Parkinson's disease. 
 The potential of a new, potent, irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B, (E)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-fluorallyamine (MDL 72145), to augment the effects of L-DOPA in an animal model which reproduces the biochemical defect of Parkinson's disease has been evaluated. 
The data provide no reason to suppose that MDL 72145 would be very different in clinical use from L-deprenyl which is both effective and well-tolerated as an adjunct to the L-DOPA-based therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 Contrast sensitivity functions were determined in a population of 18 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, and compared with the data obtained in an age-matched group of healthy controls. 
 Buspirone, an anxiolytic unrelated to benzodiazepines that may act at the presynaptic dopamine receptor, was given to 11 patients with Parkinson's disease in an open label study. 
Buspirone is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but at anxiolytic doses (less than 40 mg/day) does not adversely affect parkinsonian disability. 
Studies of patients with diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disease, and schizophrenia are in progress. 
This hypothesis was verified in patients with Parkinson's disease, a human model of a selective deficit of dopamine. 
The finding that in Parkinson's disease there is a reversible disinhibition of pituitary secretion of beta-endorphin confirms that this secretion is physiologically inhibited by tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic systems. 
Because of these properties, buspirone's usefulness in the management of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was evaluated in a controlled study of 16 outpatients with stage I-IV disease. 
 In an attempt to produce an animal model of Parkinson's disease, we injected rats repeatedly with high doses of methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), a compound which has been reported to lower striatal dopamine content in mice. 
 Dopamine D-1 receptors were analyzed in the caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, substantia nigra and nucleus accumbens in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease and in 18 age-matched controls by the binding of [3H]flupenthixol. 
A significantly increased number of D-1 receptors was found in the putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease, especially in those who were treated with levodopa. 
The results of this study indicate that there may be denervation supersensitivity of striatal neurons and also a loss of striatonigral neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
 A neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which produces pathological changes similar to human idiopathic Parkinson's disease in animals, was injected in mice for biochemical and pharmacological studies. 
Parkinson's disease), the synthesis and metabolism of dopamine probably occurs throughout the entire central nervous system. 
Dopamine and homovanillic acid concentrations were reduced in the caudate nucleus and putamen but not in the nucleus accumbens or frontal cortex, indicating that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system is lesioned in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (as in those with Parkinson's disease) but not the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, which are lesioned in parkinsonian patients. 
This lesion is also found in demented patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. 
The results suggest that MPTP-induced parkinsonism in the monkey more closely replicates the neurochemical changes seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease than previously thought. 
 In the management of Parkinson's disease physicians now have at their disposal a number of useful therapeutic tools (Figure 3). 
It also may be used safely in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The pattern of intellectual deficit in the MPTP patients was similar to that of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Since MPTP-induced parkinsonism probably represents a purely dopaminergic deficiency, these findings suggest that changes in the dopamine system are responsible for at least some of the intellectual changes of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
 Transient withdrawal of therapy has been advocated as a method of dealing with the complications of long-term use of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
We then compared the subsequent clinical course of these patients over one year with that of 30 other randomly selected, similar patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Here we discuss this finding in the context of the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease may stem from clinically silent damage to the substantia nigra, followed by slow attrition of neurones in this region because of its particular vulnerability to cell loss as a normal consequence of ageing. 
 Amantadine is one of the most commonly used drugs for the control of tremor in Parkinson's disease. 
Using the spectrophotometric procedure of Paglia and Valentine [8] and Beutler [2] we measured the activity of this enzyme in autopsied brain from 12 patients dying with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 11 neurologically normal adults matched with respect to age and postmortem interval. 
In the Parkinson's disease patients glutathione peroxidase activity was slightly but significantly reduced in several brain areas including substantia nigra. 
Although the magnitude of the glutathione peroxidase deficiency in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra was small (19% reduction), coupled with the reported marked deficiency of reduced glutathione [9] it may represent one of the contributing factors leading to nigral dopamine neurone loss. 
 Decreased numbers of pigmented neurons of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system are the most striking pathology in the brains of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is clear that neurons in the locus ceruleus, vagal nuclei, and nucleus basalis of Meynert are also affected in this disease. 
 The effects of bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease manifesting various problems in levodopa therapy were tested in a double-blind manner with the collaboration of 59 institutions. 
It is caused by the administration of neuroleptics or by the acute withdrawal of levodopa therapy in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
In the present study, we evaluated the interaction of PLG and its synthetic analogs with levodopa in two animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 The concentration of neuropeptide Y has been determined in the cortex and hippocampus of subjects with Parkinson's disease and compared to changes of activity of dopamine beta-hydroxylase and concentration of somatostatin. 
This study provides some further evidence of neurochemical similarities between the dementia of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. 
Bromocriptine, in low doses, is effective in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease, while bromocriptine in higher doses is needed in patients with advanced disease. 
Bromocriptine by itself does not discriminate between the low and the high affinity states of the dopamine receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  Exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) produces a syndrome that resembles Parkinson's disease. 
To compare the biochemical abnormalities produced by this compound in human beings with those occurring in Parkinson's disease, we examined biogenic amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid and urine from six patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism and eight patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The cerebrospinal fluid levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MHPG), the major metabolite of norepinephrine in the brain, after adjustment for plasma MHPG, were elevated (greater than 6.0 ng per milliliter) in MPTP-induced parkinsonism, whereas MHPG levels were reduced (less than 6.0) in Parkinson's disease. 
Neurons containing norepinephrine in the brain are involved in the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease, whereas they are spared in MPTP-induced parkinsonism. 
The selective destruction by MPTP of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons that is responsible for the movement disorder also appears to result in an increase in central noradrenergic activity, which is not possible in Parkinson's disease. 
The restitution and long-term maintenance of full scale sexual activity in aged male rats continuously treated with (-)deprenyl and the clinical observation that this drug prolongs in a statistically significant manner, the duration of the Parkinson's disease support the view that (-)deprenyl may improve deteriorating functions due to dopamine deficiency in the aging brain. 
Given that dopaminergic pathways are involved in affective behavior, depression, which is recognized as an integral part of Parkinson's disease, may be associated with a dopamine imbalance. 
 Neurochemical studies in Parkinson's disease have greatly contributed to the understanding of the neurobiology of the meso-telencephalic dopamine (DA) system; in addition, these studies have significantly influenced our concepts regarding the general principles of brain function. 
The DA loss which occurs during normal ageing is not of sufficient magnitude to cause clinically overt Parkinson's disease. 
On the other hand, the observations pertaining to the Parkinsonian syndrome produced by NMPTP suggest the participation of environmental factors in the aetiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The remarkable results of nigral cell transplants into the striatum of animals with experimental "parkinsonism", as well as the high therapeutic efficacy of DA substitution in patients with Parkinson's disease point toward a neurohumoral, rather than neurotransmitter, function of brain DA. 
 In normal elderly humans there is progressive motor dysfunction and loss of nigrostriatal neurons and brain dopamine similar to, although of a milder degree than, that seen in Parkinson's disease. 
 In 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, the effects of pergolide after 28 months of treatment were compared with the response after the initial 10-week therapy. 
 Pergolide mesylate, a dopamine agonist, was studied as adjunctive therapy in a 6-month double-blind trial in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease who were achieving less than optimal response from Sinemet. 
 Although Parkinson's disease has traditionally been considered as a motor disorder, there has been much recent interest in the nature and the neural substrates of parkinsonian dementia and cognitive dysfunction. 
These results not only help to clarify the function of the nigrostriatal DA projection, but also show that depletion in this system is linked specifically to a process of response initiation, which may be the fundamental impairment in Parkinson's disease. 
These observations are discussed in reference to animal models of Parkinson's disease. 
 Loss of dopaminergic neuronal function has been the most consistent biochemical abnormality found in Parkinson's disease. 
This paper provides evidence supporting an opioid system hypofunction in Parkinson's disease. 
These and other studies in rodents may help in elucidating the mechanisms involved in the destructive effects of MPTP on striatal dopamine neurons that lead to symptoms of Parkinson's disease in humans and in monkeys. 
 Twenty Parkinson's disease patients, who had not yet received levodopa, were treated with low-dose bromocriptine. 
Low-dose bromocriptine does not replace levodopa as initial therapy for Parkinson's disease. 
 In view of evidence linking cholecystokinin-containing neurons with both dopamine system function and Parkinson's disease pathophysiology, the therapeutic effects of the cholecystokinin analog, caerulein, were evaluated in 10 parkinsonian patients stabilized on L-Dopa therapy. 
Both ergolines and ergopeptines are used in treatment of Parkinson's disease and their therapeutic efficacy, as well as their propensity to develop undesirable side effects is under investigation. 
 Among the various deficiencies in neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, the loss of dopamine (DA) is implicated in a major way in the occurrence of L-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs). 
Since hyperactivity of cholinergic neurons plays a determinant role in the pathogenesis of some parkinsonian symptoms, it is conceivable that GABAergic stimulation is effective in ameliorating Parkinson's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)  Striatal dopamine receptors were studied using [3H]-spiperone in postmortem tissues of thirty-six patients with Parkinson's Disease. 
 A total of 13 patients with drug-induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease were treated with two non-classical neuroleptics-clozapine and fluperlapine. 
 To study the absorption of levodopa and interaction with the extracerebral dopamine antagonist domperidone, 15 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were given levodopa 500 mg p.o., alone, and with domperidone pre-treatment. 
L-DOPA in combination with benserazide or carbidopa constitutes the best available therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 In Parkinson's disease the decrease of dopamine in the nigro-striatal pathway is allied to modifications of other neuromodulation systems. 
sodiumselenite, may be a therapeutic alternative to other types of treatment of demential syndromes or a direct supplement to the L-DOPA treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Because of its acceptability, mesulergine might be important in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia and perhaps also of acromegaly and Parkinson's disease. 
 The compound 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induces an irreversible neurological syndrome in man and monkey which is similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease in its clinical, pathological, neurochemical and pharmacological response properties. 
The mechanism by which a peripherally administered, low-molecular weight compound exerts permanent but selective toxic effects on dopamine systems in the brain may be relevant to parkinsonian syndromes induced by other toxins and to the disease process in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
Although little has been known about its biological effects, recently MPTP has been reported to cause irreversible Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in humans and in monkeys. 
It therefore seems unlikely that a model of Parkinson's disease, suitable for exploring the etiological importance of glutathione deficiency, can be produced in rats merely by administering the largest tolerable doses of L-DOPA. 
The data are discussed in view of their significance for therapy of patients with basal ganglia disorders, such as patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
 Refractory response to dopamine (DA) agonists is a common problem in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is an illness occurring in the third stage of life. 
 The drug treatment of Parkinson's disease has progressed through 3 main stages: firstly, the use of anticholinergic drugs and amantadine; then the introduction of levodopa and its association with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors; and finally the use of direct acting dopamine agonist drugs. 
Levodopa, however, remains the most effective single drug in Parkinson's disease. 
In nigra from patients with Parkinson's disease, nigral receptor binding is only about one-third of control values. 
These data suggest that in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, L-dopa administration results in a smaller increase and a shorter duration of elevation in striatal dopamine concentration than in controls. 
These observations support the hypothesis that the "wearing-off" phenomenon that occurs during the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease occurs as a consequence of a reduction in the rate of conversion of L-dopa to dopamine and perhaps diminished capacity for the storage of dopamine. 
 A distinct clinicopathologic entity, PSP is differentiated from Parkinson's disease by the presence of supranuclear ophthalmoparesis. 
 Parkinson's disease usually involves a lengthy preclinical period during which few neurological symptoms are observed despite extensive damage to the dopaminergic nigrostriatal bundle. 
Unlike free GABA levels, the levels of conjugated GABA were not altered in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebellar ataxias, dementias, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis compared to controls. 
 Drug addicts abusing heroin substitutes contaminated with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), and perhaps those who work with this substance, may develop symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease [7, 12, 13]. 
In this review we discuss two aspects of Parkinson's disease that have been investigated in these animals. 
MPTP administration thus results in biochemical and histological changes in mice similar to those reported in humans and monkeys and similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease in humans. 
Results also suggest that both the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine systems act in concert to produce response enabling to important environmental events, and that the severe response enabling deficits observed in Parkinson's disease involves not only degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, but of the mesolimbic dopamine system as well. 
The results suggest that NMPTP causes a degenerative destruction of the striatal dopamine pathway and that NMPTP may be useful in developing a rodent model of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease most consistently involves pathologic changes in the substantia nigra, which is the major source of dopamine to the striatum. 
Thus, catecholamine-containing grafts could be potential replacements for destroyed or damaged dopaminergic neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Norepinephrine was measured in postmortem cerebellar cortex of 22 non-neurological control subjects and nine patients with Parkinson's disease, using the high-performance liquid chromatography method with amperometric detection. 
In the patients with Parkinson's disease, the cerebellar cortical norepinephrine levels were significantly below normal. 
Although the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are primarily caused by disturbed basal ganglia (dopamine) function, cerebellar dysfunction related to norepinephrine may contribute to some abnormalities of motor performance in this disorder. 
 Ergot derivatives have been proposed to have ameliorative effects in various pathological conditions where dopaminergic transmission is believed to be impaired, namely Parkinson's disease, amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, and in the treatment of behavioural disturbances of the elderly. 
 [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose scans were performed on 9 patients with Parkinson's disease and 14 normal subjects. 
With increased severity of bradykinesia and the development of mild to moderate dementia, global brain metabolism in Parkinson's disease decreased further. 
In one moderately demented patient with Parkinson's disease, severe parietal cortex hypometabolism was found, similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease. 
 The drug treatment of Parkinson's disease should be tailored to the age of the patient, coexistence of dementia or postural hypotension, duration of the disease process and the emergence of side effects. 
 It must be recognised that patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease will eventually get worse and, where appropriate, realistic prognostications of the future should be conveyed to patients and their responsible relatives. 
Is the diagnosis correct? Consider an alternative diagnosis such as progressive supranuclear palsy, drug effect, multi infarct dementia, Alzheimer's disease, striatonigral degeneration, senile or essential tremor and the Shy-Drager syndrome which all may be mistaken for Parkinson's disease. 
Is the patient complying with therapy? Is the dose adequate and the frequency of administration appropriate? Are the symptoms caused by drug therapy? Would the addition of other therapy assist, for example amantadine, anticholinergics or bromocriptine? Is the patient on other drugs which may be contributing to the impaired function? Is the patient depressed? Is there some other underlying condition aggravating the Parkinson's disease?  Blink rate, a putative noninvasive marker of central dopamine activity, was assessed in medication-free patients with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, and dystonia. 
The normal control rate of 24 blinks per minute was significantly higher than the rate of 12 and 4 blinks per minute recorded for patients with Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, respectively. 
 Depression is a common symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The brain content of serotonin in Parkinson's disease is also reduced, but this has not been related to any manifestation of the disorder. 
The data suggest that the alterations in serotonin metabolism in Parkinson's disease identify a subgroup of patients who are prone to depression. 
Only dopamine concentrations were lower than normal in Parkinson's disease, suggesting that deficiency in hypothalamic dopamine transmission may play a role in the autonomic and endocrine abnormalities of this disorder. 
 The long term consequences of the use of a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are reported. 
 Early Parkinson's disease is taken to be the best human model of disordered basal ganglia function. 
The variety of motor disorders in Parkinson's disease cannot be explained by simple concepts. 
It is argued that simple motor programs are not grossly disturbed in Parkinson's disease. 
Owing to their pharmacological profiles, dopaminergic agonists represent a valuable clinical option especially in the management of Parkinson's disease in view of the problems arising from chronic L-Dopa treatment. 
Virtually all of the problems typically encountered with dopamine precursor and agonist therapy in treating Parkinson's disease have been observed during a one and one half year follow-up period, including "end-of-dose" deterioration (or "wearing off"), "peak-dose" dyskinesias, "on-off" phenomena, and psychiatric complications. 
Finally, we suggest that the occurrence of this full array of therapeutic complications in patients with MPTP-induced parkinsonism furthers the analogy between this syndrome ane Parkinson's disease. 
 Pergolide mesylate, a long-acting dopamine agonist, is effective in treating Parkinson's disease. 
anhedonia) is a cardinal feature of clinical depression, and since the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine projections have been shown to degenerate in Parkinson's disease, it is suggested that damage to these reward-related systems may contribute directly to the high incidence of depression that has been reported in this disease. 
It is possible that earlier use of agonists, in low doses combined with similarly low doses of levodopa, may improve the long term treatment of Parkinson's disease, but as yet there is no firm evidence. 
 Parkinson's disease is associated with a variety of neurotransmitter disturbances which may be further altered by its treatment with dopamine agonists. 
This paper reviews the various therapies which have had some success in the management of Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa and dopamine agonists. 
 According to their mental status, patients with Parkinson's disease can be subdivided into three groups: (1) mentally normal patients; (2) patients with severe cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-type brain pathology (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar changes); and (3) demented patients without any evidence of Alzheimer changes. 
The original distinction between nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems nevertheless was pivotal in suggesting that the basal ganglia are related to limbic as well as to sensorimotor functions, and remains of interest because dopaminergic mechanisms may be implicated not only in the aetiology of sensorimotor impairments such as those of Parkinson's disease, but also in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. 
 The close relationship of cholecystokinin peptides with some of the dopamine pathways and the limbic system suggests a putative role for these peptides in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, manic-depression and schizophrenia. 
 Continuous intravenous infusions of L-Dopa as a treatment for response swings in Parkinson's disease are limited by the insolubility and acidity of L-Dopa. 
This may suggest that the altered GABA function in Parkinson's disease is secondary to changes in the dopamine system. 
in Parkinson's disease and after mechanical injury to the brain due to accidents or neurosurgical operations. 
In a second phase, the author challenges the tenet that Parkinson's disease is a form of chronic manganese intoxication and that manganism is an experimental model for Parkinson's disease. 
In opposition to current views, who look for causal factors in Parkinson's disease along the pathways for melanogenesis, the author thus proposes a novel hypothesis which envisions a variety of transient "trigger factors" acting at the dopamine synapse to increase dopamine turnover. 
Further studies relating to manganese in these disorders and particularly in Parkinson's disease should focus not on the "intoxication" part of the overload and its striatopallidal consequences, but on the intimate mechanism of destabilization of the homeostatic regulator in neuromelanin bearing cells, even after the exposure period. 
This reversal may play a role in the clinical changes seen in Parkinson's disease patients following chronic use of these drugs. 
 Speed of movement initiation is altered in normal aging and in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. 
The differences in [3H]spiroperidol binding and the differential influence of time provided to respond on the response latency of these two normal groups of rats was similar to that observed in old or model Parkinson's disease rats having nigrostriatal dopamine deficits. 
 Electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) has a transitory beneficial effect on patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
 We present an interim report of an ongoing, single-blind study of the effectiveness and safety of bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) in 15 patients, 14 of whom had severe idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Stages 4 and 5 on the Hoehn and Yahr Scale). 
The preliminary results of this study indicate that low-dose bromocriptine as a first-line drug in severe Parkinson's disease is definitely warranted. 
Intraneuronal monoamine oxidase may drive cellular senescence of the nigrostriatal tract in patients with Parkinson's disease by generating hydrogen peroxide and derived oxy-radicals during the metabolism of endogenous dopamine. 
 Bromocriptine, a specific dopamine receptor agonist, has been used for the treatment of various hyperprolactinemic conditions and as adjunctive therapy for acromegaly (with or without concomitant hyperprolactinemia) and Parkinson's disease. 
When bromocriptine is added to a regimen of levodopa or carbidopa, patients with Parkinson's disease frequently have additional clinical improvement and, in most patients, the levodopa or carbidopa dose can be reduced. 
Withdrawal of bromocriptine therapy is associated in most patients with reversal of its beneficial effects--return of hyperprolactinemia, return of excess growth hormone secretion, and exacerbation of Parkinson's disease. 
It is also suggested that PLG and its active analogues warrant further vigorous and systematic clinical trials to establish their therapeutic efficacy in Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic drug induced tardive dyskinesia and related extrapyramidal motor disorders. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterized by a deficiency of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system. 
 The therapeutic use of dopamine agonists for Parkinson's disease, clinical guidelines for their introduction into antiparkinson regimens, and their range of adverse effects are reviewed. 
This non-specific binding in lymphocytes corresponds to trapping, presumably in lysosomes and thus does not reflect the dopaminergic receptors state in Parkinson's disease. 
 Mazindol, a drug that blocks the reuptake of dopamine, was studied in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in both a pilot study (12 patients) and a controlled trial (11 patients). 
Gangliosides may therefore possibly represent a new type of drug in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and aging processes in DA systems. 
With the exception of Parkinson's disease, there is little evidence that treatments which decrease DA function are potent inducers of depression, but it is argued that such a relationship might not necessarily be expected. 
Dopamine deficiency in the nigrostriatal system is a characteristic of Parkinson's disease, and a disturbance of dopamine metabolism is still widely held to be responsible for the syndrome of schizophrenia. 
Both in Parkinson's disease with a known hypoactivity of dopamine neurons and in schizophrenia with a postulated hyperfunction of these systems, pathological alterations of the dopamine cell groups can be observed. 
Dysfunction of spinal dopaminergic neurons could be involved in the pathophysiology of certain conditions, such as Parkinson's disease. 
 A patient suffering from delusional depression, Parkinson's disease, and tardive dyskinesia (TD) exhibited a marked improvement in mood and parkinsonian symptoms following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). 
 Because evidence for the neurotransmitter role of dopamine in the gray matter of the spinal cord is accumulating, a question arises of whether or not spinal dopamine receptors are also involved in the effects of dopaminomimetics which are believed to induce beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease through an action thought to be mediated mainly by striatal dopamine receptors. 
We suggest, therefore, that there exists a correlation between the behavioral effects, which are generally accepted as laboratory models of Parkinson's disease, and the enhanced apomorphine concentration in the spinal cord. 
 The effects of anticholinergic and dopaminergic drugs used for Parkinson's disease were studied on the tremor induced by physostigmine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) in rats. 
Thus L-methionine might be a new potential drug for Parkinson's disease treatment. 
 The effects of Rolipram, a new phosphodiesterase inhibitor, were assessed in a double-blind trial versus placebo in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease already under treatment. 
 Abnormal involuntary movements caused by chronic levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease, tardive dyskinesia resulting from long-term treatment with neuroleptics, and Huntington's disease all seem to be related to functional alteration and/or derangement of the DA/ACh systems. 
Our results suggest an involvement mainly of D1 receptors in the pathogenesis of TD, whereas D2 receptors seem to be important in the onset of AIM after chronic levodopa treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
Low age at onset of Parkinson's disease, and at the commencement of levodopa therapy, the duration of levodopa treatment and a high dose of levodopa seem to be significant risk factors for the development of response fluctuations, but not the pretreatment duration of Parkinson's disease nor the disability of the patients. 
It is important, moreover, to try to prevent these phenomena by taking into account the predictive risk factors of response fluctuations in the treatment strategy of Parkinson's disease. 
 The most crucial unanswered question in Parkinson's disease is its fundamental cause. 
As in Alzheimer's disease, another of the degenerative diseases of the brain of unknown origin with a specific biochemical substrate, any etiologic hypothesis for Parkinson's disease--whether a virus, an age-related immune system dysfunction, a genetic factor, a "trophic" substance, or a toxin--would have to explain the selective involvement of specific transmitter-defined neuronal pathways, the non-specificity of the brain lesions that define the disease, and the clinical involvement of a sizeable segment of the aging population. 
In addition, a supplement of deprenyl in Parkinson's disease led to significant prolongation of the duration of the illness. 
 1 Dopamine deficiency in the brain is the prime biochemical deficit in Parkinson's disease, but loss of noradrenaline and 5HT also may contribute. 
4 Drug therapy designed to increase or decrease brain 5HT function has had no consistent effect in Parkinson's disease. 
5 Manipulation of brain noradrenergic activity in Parkinson's disease had little effect, although the noradrenaline precursor L-threo-DOPS may reduce freezing attacks. 
6 Until more specific drug molecules are available the role of brain noradrenergic and 5HT mechanisms in Parkinson's disease remains uncertain. 
Oxy-radicals, and hydrogen peroxide generated by monoamine oxidase, can contribute to increased rates of senescence of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. 
The evidence that oxy-radicals and monoamine oxidase are potentially cytotoxic is reviewed, and a pathobiology of dopamine neuron senescence in Parkinson's disease is proposed. 
 Clinical responses to bromocriptine and three new ergoline derivatives, CM 29-712, CQ 32-084, and CU 32-085, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease were studied in new, non-levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients. 
It is evident that more effective, specific, and tolerable dopaminergic agonists are needed before they can be considered a primary treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Twenty patients with advanced progressing Parkinson's disease have been treated with the 8-alpha-ergoline CU 32-085 in combination therapy for 3 months. 
The compound was considered useful in the treatment of advanced, progressing Parkinson's disease. 
Recently, the use of selective MAO-B blockers has shown beneficial effects in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
in Parkinson's disease, in the substantia nigra) the neuropharmacology of the glycine system is still poorly understood. 
Dysfunction of GABA receptors occurs in various neurological states, as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. 
 The therapeutic effects of dopamine (DA) agonists and DA antagonists used in the treatment of schizophrenia (antipsychotics, DA antagonists), Huntington's chorea (DA antagonists) and Parkinson's disease (antiparkinsonian agents, DA agonists) have been thought to result largely from actions on DA receptors located in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). 
Clinical studies have revealed that pergolide is an effective drug in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and it reduces the "on-off" phenomena. 
GSH was virtually absent in the nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
If confirmed, the hypothesis that loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons results from a regional GSH deficiency could have important therapeutic implications for the management and prevention of Parkinson's disease. 
During chronic manganese intoxication the neuropsychiatric symptoms manifested earlier disappear and are followed by a permanent neurological phase typified by extrapyramidal symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease. 
 Nucleolar volume and melanin pigment were measured in nerve cells of the substantia nigra in cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and in other cases of parkinsonism associated with cerebrovascular disease. 
 The cause(s) of response fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease treated chronically with levodopa is unknown. 
 The most prominent neuropathological lesions in Parkinson's disease have been found in the substantia nigra. 
In Parkinson's disease, CCK-8-I levels were only decreased in the substantia nigra where dopamine cell bodies lie, and not in striatal and corticolimbic dopamine projecting areas. 
Our results suggest that the major proportion of dopaminergic neurones degenerated in Parkinson's disease may not contain the CCK-8 peptide. 
 Levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in CSF were measured in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 14) and sex-matched controls (n = 14). 
The mean (+/- SD) CSF GABA levels were 200 +/- 70 pmole/mL in controls and 121 +/- 52 pmole/mL in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In the untreated patients with Parkinson's disease, the CSF GABA level was 95 +/- 31 pmole/mL (n = 7) and in those who were treated with levodopa and carbidopa the level was 144 +/- 53 pmole/mL (n = 8). 
No significant difference was seen in plasma GABA levels between the controls and patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The decreased GABA level in CSF, which was elevated by levodopa, supports the concept that in Parkinson's disease, the GABA-dopamine interaction in the substantia nigra may be an important compensatory mechanism counteracting the dopamine neuronal loss. 
 Pergolide, a semisynthetic ergoline and a potent long-acting adenylcyclase-linked dopamine agonist, was given to 40 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease whose response to levodopa had diminished considerably. 
Pergolide is effective in Parkinson's disease and will change the management of patients whose response to levodopa has diminished. 
The results are discussed in the light of changes of sensitivity of cerebral dopamine receptors, an increase in receptor numbers, and the tolerance to L-DOPA which often develop in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 To determine whether 1-tyrosine administration can enhance dopamine synthesis in humans as it does in rats, we measured levels of tyrosine and the major dopamine metabolite, homovanillic acid, in lumbar spinal fluids of 23 patients with Parkinson's disease before and during ingestion of 100 mg/kg/day of tyrosine. 
[3H]Strychnine binding was significantly decreased in the substantia nigra from Parkinson's disease patients, both in the pars compacta (67% of control) and the pars reticulata (50% of control), but not in the inferior olivary nucleus. 
The possible advantages of budipine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are discussed in comparison to the drugs used in therapy today. 
 Treatment of newly diagnosed or previously untreated patient with Parkinson's disease requires an individualized approach based largely on the severity of the manifestations. 
Profile determinations of the drug effect, demand scheduling, and use of anticholinergic drugs, amantadine, or bromocriptine during the later stages of the disease are the key to the presently available optimal treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Such activations could contribute to reestablish sufficient release of DA when the dopaminergic function is impaired as in Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease ranks among the most prevalent neurological diseases in the elderly. 
The primary etiology of Parkinson's disease is still unknown, although the aging process may be an important predisposing factor. 
There is some overlapping between Parkinson's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer's type, although both seem to be disease entities. 
In Parkinson's disease, the most prominent and significant neuropathological change is the progressive loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons. 
Thus in some patients with Parkinson's disease a denervation supersensitivity seemed to develop and in others a loss of postsynaptic dopamine receptor sites in the neostriatum. 
DBH activity was significantly increased in the A2-C2 area of the medulla oblongata (including the nucleus tractus solitarius) in the cases of Parkinson's disease. 
The results are compatible with the hypothesis that differential modulation of CNS dopamine receptors by PLG is functionally associated with interacting with specific PLG binding sites in the rat and human brain, and pose implications for Parkinson's disease and tardive dyskinesia. 
 Bromocriptine (CB-154) and the 8-alpha-ergoline CU 32-085, two dopamine receptor agonists, were administered at different times to two series of 22 patients with Parkinson's disease, most of whom took levodopa (plus benserazide) at optimum dosage. 
Both compounds were useful in the management of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, CU 32-085 having a stronger effect on tremor, bradykinesia, fluctuations and "on-off' effects than bromocriptine. 
In Parkinson's disease, loss of ascending nigrostriatal fibers is associated with reduction of presynaptic dopamine binding and increase of postsynaptic dopamine binding. 
 Madopar, a combination of levodopa with benserazide, induced an inconsistent rise in plasma growth hormone in unmedicated patients with Parkinson's disease and in controls, and a greater growth hormone rise in Parkinsonian subjects on chronic Madopar therapy. 
The principal question addressed in this article is, "How do DA mechanisms promote neurobehavioral consequences such as the symptoms of schizophrenia?" Other topics covered include Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, and intracranial self-stimulation drive-reward mechanisms. 
4 The compounds AGN-1133 and AGN-1135 show most promise in Parkinson's disease or as anti-depressants because of their irreversible selective type B MAO inhibition in vitro and in vivo. 
Compared with the recommendations for its use in Parkinson's diseases, over 75% of patients received inadequate and widely spaced doses. 
These findings suggest that many of these patients did not have Parkinson's disease but rather rigid-akinetic syndromes associated with degenerative brain disease. 
 In the last decade neurohormone replacement therapy with levodopa has revolutionised the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Physical therapy and emotional support for the patients and their families are an integral part of the management of the patient with Parkinson's disease. 
 Amantadine is useful for the prevention and treatment of influenza A and for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders. 
 Electrophysiological and pharmacological analysis of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesia and tardive dyskinesia (L.DD) due to neuroleptics was performed on 12 patients with Parkinson's disease and on 12 others with psychotic diseases. 
The validity of this apparently paradoxical use of CDP-choline with antagonistic effect on DA neurons in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
Chronically, changes in the level of dopaminergic stimulation modulate the number of at least some receptor subtypes, resulting in "up or down regulation." An increase in receptor number appears central to the pathology of Parkinson's disease, tardive dyskinesia, and perhaps schizophrenia. 
It seems that levodopa has only a limited period of optimal usefulness in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
However, at present there is no better or more potent therapeutic agent available than levodopa and it is still the primary treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
Post-mortem brain studies have shown that in Parkinson's disease there is not only a progressive loss of dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons but there are also significant changes in the striatal dopamine receptors. 
Current difficulties in the management of Parkinson's disease greatly depend on the fact that we are dealing with a symptomatic therapy. 
It is hoped that future research will soon lead to a discovery of the primary cause and consequently to a causal therapy of Parkinson's disease. 
 (3H) spiroperidol binding has been measured in lymphocytes from patients with Parkinson's disease and age matched healthy volunteers. 
Examples of Parkinson's disease (tyrosine), myasthenia gravis (choline or phosphatidylcholine), depression (tyrosine), and possibly abnormal appetite (tryptophan). 
 Patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with different antiparkinsonian drugs and the amino acid levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were determined. 
These results suggest that KW-5338 prevents side effects of L-DOPA such as nausea, vomiting and constipation, without reduction in therapeutic effects of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease. 
The observation of a modulation by estrogens of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and tardive dyskinesias suggests the implication of sex steroids in neurology, psychiatry and behavior. 
 Salivary and plasma concentrations of bromocriptine (BCT), a dopamine agonist, were measured by gas chromatography in four patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 In 14 patients with Parkinson's disease on long-term therapy the erythrocyte catechol-O-methyltransferase activity was found to correlate with the average plasma concentration ratio of 3-O-methyldopa to levodopa and with the fasting plasma concentration ratio of 3-O methyldopa to levodopa. 
 An association of Althesin and Phentanyl succinylcholine is proposed as anaesthetic in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Psychological morbidity is a common consequence of both Parkinson's disease and its treatment with antiparkinsonian agents. 
The authors describe an unusual case of a patient with Parkinson's disease and a psychosis who was treated with levodopa/carbidopa and very low dose perphenazine. 
The compounds used were Benserazide and Carbidopa, two inhibitors of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase used together with dopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and the anti-tubercular agent isoniazid. 
As such, it is implicated in the aetiology and therapy of various disease conditions--for example, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease and tardive dyskinesia. 
 Diseases of the extrapyramidal systems like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea have been closely associated with the basal ganglia. 
Two examples are given to illustrate the role of dopamine in brain disorders: a) In Parkinson's disease there is a marked deficiency of dopamine in several subcortical brain regions, particularly the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and substantia nigra. 
 A unique case reported of a patient with right-sided Parkinson's disease and left-sided tardive dyskinesia. 
This unique case provides insight into the pathogeneis of Parkinson's disease, the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia, their successful therapeutic approaches, and possibly the effect of drugs in blocking the progression of Parkinson's disease. 
 Over the last two decades there have been spectacular advances in understanding and treating Parkinson's disease, but there remain major areas of uncertainty and ignorance. 
Finally, the nature of Parkinson's disease is still an enigma: we have not identified its cause, and we do not know what influences its progress. 
Deprenyl, a selective MAO 'type B inhibitor without the 'cheese effect', is the most potent inactivator of human brain MAO, and clinical results show that the drug is very useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and depression. 
 Dopamine is predominantly oxidized by a (-)-deprenyl sensitive form of MAO in the human striatum, and (-)-deprenyl, acting at some suitably low selective inhibitory concentration may, therefore, be of benefit in Parkinson's disease. 
In Parkinson's disease the lower levels of L-glutamic acid decarboxylase observed in the EPS is likely not associated with neuronal cell loss but is likely secondary to the dopamine neuron loss. 
Selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors like deprenyl, however, have been tried with success as adjuvant therapy in Parkinson's disease and depression because of their ability to inhibit dopamine oxidation. 
The observation of a modulation by estrogens of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and tardive dyskinesias suggests the implication of sex steroids in neurology, psychiatry and behavior. 
nigra) and frontal cortex of control subjects and of patients with Parkinson's disease and the Shy-Drager syndrome. 
nigra in both Parkinson's disease and Shy-Drager syndrome, and a reduced affinity of dopamine receptor sites in the caudate nucleus in Shy-Drager syndrome. 
A review of the literature shows a high incidence of duodenal ulcers in patients with Parkinson's disease (associated with dopamine deficiency) and a low occurrence in schizophrenics (associated with dopamine excess and/or hyperactivity). 
The existence of oxidative pathways for catecholamines suggests that defects in their compartmentalization, transport, or degradation may present the cell with sufficient levels of cytotoxic quinones and free radical species to result in the degeneration of neurons observed in Parkinson's disease. 
 The activity of DBH enzyme was measured in plasma of 7 non treated patients suffering from Parkinson's disease; a 10 mg dose of Bromocryptine was administered per os to these patients. 
It was pointed out that in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease the decrease of DBH level in plasma after the administration of Bromocryptine was of 32.6% +/- SE 4.4% while in the group of control the decrease was only of 15% +/- SE 4.9%. 
This should mean that peripheric pre-synaptic dopaminergic receptors are involved in the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. 
 Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by the xenon 133 inhalation method in 60 patients with Parkinson's disease and compared with flow data obtained in 51 age-matched normal control subjects. 
The present study provides additional evidence for involvement of the cerebral cortex in Parkinson's disease. 
 The plasma kinetics of bromocriptine (BCT), a long-acting dopamine agonist, was studied in twelve patients with Parkinson's disease, using a newly developed gas chromatographic method of analysis. 
Combination of domperidone with dopamine agonists may result in more effective treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Tiapride, a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide, reduced levodopa-induced peak dose involuntary movements in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
The reduced D.B.H.-activity after treatment with 2-Bromo-alpha-ergocriptine may be explained by a pronounced antagonistic influence of 2-Bromo-alpha-ergocriptine on the presynaptic dopamine receptors, suggesting that presynaptic dopaminergic receptors are involved in Parkinson's disease. 
This suggests that there may exist a functional disturbance in the postsynaptic (post-DA-nergic) region in the striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease; in addition, the decrease in basal as well as DA stimulated activity as measured in homogenates may not be the biochemical substrate for the hypothetical "denervation supersensitivity" expected to occur in Parkinson's disease. 
 Because it is commonly believed that acetylcholine is a synaptic transmitter in the caudate nucleus and that the reduction of striatal biogenic amines in Parkinson's disease leads to acetylcholine supersensitivity in the caudate nucleus, we investigated the effects of the muscarinic blocking agent scopolamine on synaptic responses of neurons in the intact feline caudate nucleus and in the caudate nucleus depleted of dopamine by long-standing nigrostriatal lesions. 
Dopamine is certainly important in the control of motor pathways, as shown by the dopamine deficiency syndrome in Parkinson's disease, and is possibly of significance in the abnormal behaviour of psychotics. 
 Plasma PRL was measured at 20-min intervals in six patients with Parkinson's disease under various treatment protocols. 
The results of these studies showed that two untreated patients with Parkinson's disease had normal 24-h mean PRL levels with the normal increase during sleep. 
In addition, the preservation of normal PRL regulation in the two untreated patients with Parkinson's disease suggests that dopaminergic neurons are not universally affected in this disorder. 
Indeed, the introduction of levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and of the phenothiazines and related drugs for schizophrenia and psychosis has been a hallmark of neuropharmacologic research. 
 In a study of oesophageal motility in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease, intravenous atropine produced marked disruption of co-ordination in response to swallows, when compared with control subjects. 
Our findings, therefore, provide no support for the belief that there is a generalised defect of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease. 
The author discusses the physiopathology of neuromotor disorders wuch as Parkinson's disease, chorea, and various types of dyskinesias, in relation to this dual mediation. 
 Oxiperomide, a new dopamine-receptor antagonist, was found to decrease dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease receiving levodopa or other dopamine agonists without necessarily increasing Parkinsonian symptoms. 
 Six patients with Parkinson's disease developed nocturnal myoclonic attacks after prolongued treatment with L-Dopa which were electroencephalographically recorded. 
 The influence of prodipin, a putative dopamine releasing compound, on the concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the spinal liquor of 28 patients with Parkinson's disease was investigated. 
 Clinical and neuropharmacological evidence indicates the involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, as well as in iatrogenic Parkinsonism and drug-induced schizophrenia-like syndrome. 
The evidence hitherto presented stresses the existence of a reversed relationship between Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia and implicates the possibility that dysfunction of dopamine-receptors may be a central phenomenon in both diseases. 
In view of the recent demonstration of two separate dopamine-receptors, it is postulated that a striatal receptor blockade may cause Parkinson's disease, whereas a limbic receptor blockade may result in schizophrenia. 
The recent discovery that several autoimmune diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, are the result of an immunopharmacological block at receptor sites, together with several observations of immunological disorders in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, suggests the possibility that certain types of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia might be the consequence of an autoimmune blockade of striatal or limbic dopamine-receptors, respectively. 
 Bromocriptine was used for Parkinson's disease in 15 patients for 20 weeks. 
We suggest careful and frequent controls of neuroendocrine secretion patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease who are treated with high doses of dopamine receptor stimulators, since the response of some pituitary hormones to bromocriptine are very marked. 
This study of schizophrenic patients, and our previous research in Parkinson's disease, suggest that urinary dopamine excretion may reflect dopaminergic function of the extrapyramidal motor system in both conditions. 
 Levodopa has become established as the treatment of choice in Parkinson's disease. 
Its beneficial effect in Parkinson's disease probably depends upon temporarily restoring the ability of degenerating nigro-striatal cells to release dopamine. 
The introduction of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is generally regarded as one of the uncommon examples in medicine where effective therapy has resulted from systematic research rather than seredipity. 
 The therapeutic effect of the combination of levodopa and carbidopa ("Sinemet") was compared with that of levodopa alone in 21 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Both drugs were shown to be of therapeutic value in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were no longer responsive to levodopa combined with carbidopa. 
The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of mixed agonist-antigonists of DA and alpha-adrenergic receptors in Parkinson's disease and in geriatric disorders were considered. 
 In Parkinson's disease, the concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) was reduced in lumbar CSF from patients with idiopathic Parkinsonism (n = 54, P less than 0.05) and post-encephalitic Parkinsonism (n = 19, P less than 0.01). 
The changes found in Parkinson's disease are described. 
 Lergotrile mesylate, an ergot alkaloid derivative and putative dopamine agonist, was effective in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease who were showing signs of disease progression despite treatment with levodopa combined with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa). 
 The relationship between dopamine receptor activation and the relief of parkinsonian clinical features was studied in 40 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Forty-two patients with Parkinson's disease were given amantadine HC1 (Symmetrel) and placebo in an 18 week double-blind cross-over study to determine if amantadine provided additional benefit when combined with levodopa and carbidopa (Sinemet). 
The observed effects of tricyclic anti-depressants on striatal DA may be relevant to the beneficial effect of these compounds in Parkinson's disease. 
 We have studied the urinary excretion of 1,4-methylhistamine (1,4-MeHm), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in patients with Parkinson's disease, choreiform movements and essential tremor. 
The effect of amantadine on urinary excretion has been measured in each group of patients as well as the effect of levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, excretion of 1,4-MeHm and HVA was significantly lower than in controls. 
Administration of amantadine to patients with Parkinson's disease was not followed by increased excretion of monoamine metabolites except in those patients who were already receiving anticholinergic drugs. 
These findings lend no support to the view that amantadine has a general amine-releasing action although there is limited evidence for such an effect in Parkinson's disease. 
Levodopa may thus modify the turnover of histamine, which appears to be reduced in Parkinson's disease, and this effect may be modified by amantadine. 
 Five patients with Parkinson's disease, when first seen, manifested an abnormal increase in appetite. 
Abnormally increased appetite (bulimia) is proposed as a new autonomic sign in Parkinson's disease. 
 The pathophysiology, anticholinergic therapy and dopaminergic therapy of Parkinson's disease are reviewed; an emphasis is placed on the structure and function of the basal ganglia because of their importance in understanding the pharmacotherapy of parkinsonism. 
The pharmacologic management of Parkinson's disease is limited primarily to manipulation of the dopamine-acetylcholine system. 
Levodopa, with or without a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, is the current drug of choice in the management of idiopathic and postencephalitic Parkinson's disease. 
Levodopa clearly has no place in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced Parkinson's disease; anticholinergics and antihistamines are the agents of choice. 
LON 954 appears to be more specific than oxotremorine for the detection of drugs having therapeutic potential in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, particularly those exerting their effect through dopaminergic systems. 
 In a study of 16 psychotic patients with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease and L-Dopa-induced hyperkinesia it was found that (1) tardive dyskinesia, compared to L-Dopa hyperkinesia, was localized almost exclusively to the oral region (P mean value of 0.01), whereas theL-Dopa hyperkinesia was more pronounced in the neck (P mean value of 0.05) and the extremities (P mean value of 0.05); (2) L-Dopa hyperkinesia showed an increasing tendency to oral preponderance with age, irrespective of the severity ofParkinsonism and extra-oral hyperkinesia, while tardive dyskinesia only itensified with age, without any change in distribution; and (3) extra-oral L-Dopa hyperkinesia was related to the localization and severity of pretreatment Parkinsonism, and more to bradykinesia than to rigidity and tremor. 
This hypothesis may have application to the understanding of neurological and mental disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
 In contrast to antipsychosis drugs which inhibit the dopamine-activated adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] of caudate nucleus, dopaminergic drugs for treatment of Parkinson's disease stimulate this cyclase. 
Thus, the mechanism by which dopaminergic medications ameliorate the effects of Parkinson's disease includes activation of the dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase. 
 Nine patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and 2 cases of Parkinsonian syndrome were treated with bromocriptine, for 41 to 117 days, with a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg. 
Bromocriptine appears to be an interesting development in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
The implication of this study is that L-dopa and related treatments only mask the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and are not retarding the underlying pathological process. 
This indicates that over a prolonged period, before Parkinson's disease is clinically evident, there is a physiological compensation for the slow loss of dopamine neurons (i.e. 
compensated stage of Parkinson's disease). 
Postmortem examination of Parkinson's disease brains and study of animal models indicate that the following mechanisms may contribute to this CNS compensation: 1) A decrease in striatal cholinergic activity, in an attempt to maintain a critical DA:ACh balance; and 2) A decrease in activity of GABA neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra, resulting in an increased firing rate of nigral dopamine cells. 
These mechanisms allow the brain to readjust to the initial dopamine cell loss in Parkinson's disease. 
 Bromocriptine (CB-154) is regarded as a dopamine agonist, hence is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
In patients with Parkinson's disease, the DA concentration in the parolfactory gyrus and nucleur accumbens was markedly reduced, whereas little change was seen in the olfactory areas. 
 The sleep pattern was studied in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease with polygraphic recording of EEG tracings, eyeball movements, EMG from the chin area and EEG during two overnight investigations. 
 The authors describe the results of biochemical analysis carried out on 28 patients with Parkinson's disease who had been treated by L-dopa. 
The authors express the view that abnormal movements while under L-Dopa treatment are dependent on two factors: one, the hypersensitivity of dopaminergic reception, the other, the greater or lesser preponderance of the COMT isozyme giving rise to 4-O-methylates;  In Parkinson's disease as well as presenile dementia there is a dopamine deficit in the basal ganglia. 
 The degeneration of the substantia nigra that characterises Parkinson's disease may cause an alteration in sensitivity of striatal dopamine receptors. 
The rotating rodent is an animal model commonly used to study the phenomenon of striatal dopamine receptor supersensitivity, and to investigate drugs which may prove to be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
It does not do so and the relevance of these findings to the treatment of Parkinson's disease is discussed. 
Loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurones characterizes Parkinson's disease, and it is probably for this reason that indirect dopamine (DA) agonists, whose actions depend on intact presynaptic mechanisms, are less active. 
Nomifensine was not shown to be of antiparkinsonian value in these patients but may be of value as an antidepressant in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
Since chorea appears to be the clinical counterpart of Parkinson's disease a number of investigations on dopamine metabolism have been carried out by measuring dopamine in the post-mortem choreic brain, and HVA, a metabolite of dopamine, in the CSF of patients. 
The different biochemical profile of the analog compared to MIF may be importance with regard to potential clinical use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and depression. 
 The response to different doses of bromocriptine (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg) has been established in six patients with Parkinson's disease. 
It suggests that Parkinson's disease may not be simply a striatal dopamine deficiency syndrome and that treatment with levodopa is more than replacement therapy. 
 Two patients with Parkinson's disease and renal insufficiency had excessively high concentrations of amantadine hydrochloride in the blood. 
 Amantadine is a putative dopaminergic compound known to be therapeutically effective in idiopathic and postencephalitic Parkinson's disease. 
 Monozygotic twin sisters developed Parkinson's disease and anosmia at the age of 39. 
 Plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase was studied in 96 subjects, 33 of them controls and 63 of them patients (Parkinson's disease, chronic chorea, torsion dystonia, postural tremor and epilepsy). 
The evidence that dopaminergic transmission in the corpus striatum is impaired in Parkinson's disease suggests that observations on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia may illuminate the patholophysiology of the latter disease. 
Four cases are reported in which an illness with schizophrenic features developed in the setting of longstanding Parkinson's disease; attention is drawn to earlier reports of schizophrenic illnesses occurring as postencephalitic sequelae in the presence of a parkinsonian syndrome. 
 Piribedil, a dopamine agonist, was administered to 13 patients with long-standing Parkinson's disease whose major symptoms were not well controlled on levodopa, anticholinergics, alpha-methyldopa, amantadine, or a combination of these agents. 
 This review evaluates the long-term results of Levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease upon quality of life, prolongation of survival and excess mortality. 
It ends by looking at new avenues of etiological research in Parkinson's disease which may indicate specific accelerated ageing of catecholaminergic (pigmented) neuronal systems. 
 A systematic study of the central and peripheral nervous systems in 3 cases of Parkinson's disease has demonstrated that Lewy bodies are present in 27 nuclei. 
It is noticed that the distribution of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease described here corresponds surprisingly well to that of monoamine (dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin) cell bodies demonstrated in rats by the histochemical fluorescence method. 
 Amantadine has been used since 1969 in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 Parkinson's disease is characterised by an imbalance between acetylcholine and dopamine which probably results from the degeneration of a dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. 
 Six patients with Parkinson's disease and five controls were premedicated with probenecid and the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-methyldopathydrazine (Carbidopa) before intravenous administration of 50 muc of 14C-L-dopa in tracer quantity. 
 Studies of pulse rate and blood pressure responses to graded intravenous infusions of noradrenaline and dopamine were performed on five patients with Parkinson's disease, five with the Shy-Drager syndrome and seven healthy subject. 
Cardiovascular reflex responses to standing and to the Valsalva manoeuvre were found to be preserved in all patients with Parkinson's disease but to be grossly defective or absent in all with the Shy-Drager syndrome. 
Heart rate decreased during pressor responses to noradrenaline in control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease, but increased in those with the Shy-Drager syndrome. 
Compared to control subjects supersensitivity to noradrenaline was observed both in patients with Parkinson's disease and, to a greater extent, in those with the Shy-Drager syndrome. 
Subsensitivity to dopamine was observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, but supersensitivity in those with the Shy-Drager syndrome. 
 Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch) levels were measured in patients with Huntington's chorea (N=11), Parkinson's disease (N=8), and subjects at risk for Huntington's chorea (N=4), and all three groups were found not to differ significantly from normal controls (N=10). 
 To avoid the main drawbacks of prolonged treatment with levodopa (involuntary movements and the "on-off" phenomenon), we administered apomorphine by mouth to 14 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
We conclude that N-propylnoraporphine is very useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 
 The tripeptide, prolyl-leucyl glycine amide, a melanocyte-stimulating hormone inhibitory factor (MIF-I), which has been reported to be effective in improving symptoms of Parkinson's disease, has been compared with drugs known to activate dopamine receptors in rat and mouse brain. 
These results suggest that the reported beneficial effect of MIF-I in Parkinson's disease is unlikely to be due to an interaction with dopamine systems in the brain. 
 Fifty patients attending a neurological outpatient clinic for Parkinson's disease were assessed by standardized methods for both physical and psychiatric symptoms. 
The probable relevance of the findings of the study to the management of patients with Parkinson's disease is outlined. 
 Thirty-one patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with the ergot alkaloid bromocriptine, a drug which stimulates dopamine receptors. 
This was determined in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease after 1-15 mg bromocriptine. 
 Carbohydrate metabolism and insulin secretion were investigated in 26 patients with Parkinson's disease before and during L-dopa treatment. 
 Biperiden hydrochloride has been used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders within two drugs: --Akinophyl, --and Akineton which is chemically similar but has a slower effect. 
 Since there is substantial evidence for a nigrostriatal dopamine defect in Parkinson's disease and since monoamine oxidase (MAO) appears to be essential for the degradation of dopamine, we investigated whether this enzyme is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease or in the therapeutic action of L-dopa. 
 In an attempt to determine the mechanism of action of L-proly-L-leucyl-glycine amide (MIF-I) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, various parameters of dopaminergic neuronal function were studied in rats.

Long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease with L-dopa resulted in an increase in SGOT, LGOT, and SGPT activity over approximately 2 months, with subsequent normalization of these enzyme activities in spite of continued therapy. 
 Post-mortem brain material from control and Parkinson's disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of L-dopa as a therapeutic agent. 
It was concluded that L-dopa's principal therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease are consistent with its transformation to DA in the striatum. 
 In Parkinson's disease there is a derangement of the metabolism of at least 3 major brain monoamines, namely, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). 
On the basis of neurochemical-clinical correlations Parkinson's disease may be subdivided into (a) an asymptomatic stage during which the striatal DA deficiency may reach a marked degree but can be compensated by the remaining DA neurons, and (b) the stage of decompensation (i.e. 
The decrease in brain 5-HT may be related to aspects of Parkinson's disease in turn related to affective behavior and mood. 
 The further therapeutic benefit of piribedil when combined with amantadine or Levodopa was studied by a double-blind, cross-over trial in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Twenty-three patients with Parkinson's disease participated in long-term, double-blind evaluations of the effectiveness and side effects of amantadine in combination with levodopa therapy. 
5 It is suggested that the potentiation of neuronal responses to dopamine by desipramine may be responsible for the therapeutic efficacy of desipramine in Parkinson's disease. 
 A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with long-term follow-up of amantadien i- Parkinson's disease was performed on 26 patients. 
Amantadine appears effective in the long-term treatment of some patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Because it has been proposed that the reduction of the striatal biogenic amines in Parkinson's disease leads to an imbalance between the actions of acetylcholine and dopamine, we have studied the effects of these substances, liberated from multibarrelled micropipettes, on the firing of single neurons in the feline caudate nucleus depleted of biogenic amines by long-standing nigrostriatal lesions. 
 The probenecid technique was used in study of the central dopamine DA metabolism in patients with depressions, psychotic disorders, and Parkinson's disease. 
 In 13 elderly patients, 12 of whom had Parkinson's disease, visual hallucinations and delirium developed as a side effect of amantadine hydrochloride (Symmetrel) therapy. 
Although amantadine is effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in the elderly, the incidence of delirium as a complication seems higher in this age group. 
 To estimate the effect of long-term administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa) on methylation of compounds not formed from it, the urinary excretion of histamine and its methylated metabolites was studied in rats and guinea pigs fed L-Dopa in their diets and in patients with Parkinson's disease being treated with L-Dopa. 
When compared to normal control subjects, patients with Parkinson's disease excreted less histamine and methylhistamine, both before and during treatment with L-Dopa. 
Although known to interfere with central dopamine mechanisms, it is frequently used in Parkinson's disease to prevent levodopa-induced nausea and vomiting. 
In this study metoclopramide did not increase Parkinsonism or reduce levodopa-induced involuntary movements in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
 Two patients with severe Parkinson's disease were treated with electroconvulsive therapy for a supervening depression. 
On the contrary, ECT may be the treatment of choice for certain patients with Parkinson's disease, whether nor not it is complicated by intractable depression. 
Their action in Parkinson's disease may be limited because of pre-existing striatal dopamine deficiency. 
Side-effects of amphetamines, anorexia, and CNS stimulation are different from those caused by levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
These observations closely mimic those found in Parkinson's disease. 
Yet metoclopramide, in anti-emetic doses, has no effect on disability in Parkinson's disease or on the therapeutic benefit of L-Dopa and L-Dopa dyskinesias. 
 The effect of a new dopaminergic agonist, piribedil, was studied in 16 patients with Parkinson's disease and compared with placebo and L-DOPA. 
The fact that parkinsonian platelets exhibit impaired dopamine uptake, while age-matched control platelets do not, constitutes the first direct evidence in favor of a generalized dopamine defect in Parkinson's disease. 
Benzhexol lessened the rigidity and improved the flexion of posture of Parkinson's disease, but had little or no effect on akinesia and tremor. 
 Twenty-seven patients with Parkinson's disease participated in a double-blind crossover trial of L-dopa and amantadine. 
 The static and dynamic components of the tonic stretch reflex and shortening reactions have been studied in biceps brachii, triceps, hamstrings, and quadriceps muscles of 19 patients with Parkinson's disease before and during L-dopa therapy.

 One hundred patients with Parkinson's disease were treated with levodopa for more than a year at UCLA Medical Center. 
There is no doubt that levodopa is the most effective treatment now available for Parkinson's disease. 
 The activity of L-dopa decarboxylase was greatly reduced in the striatum, less so in the hypothalamus, and unchanged in the cortex of brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. 
If the platelet is a valid model for dopaminergic brain neurones, then the results described would suggest that dopamine uptake and storage may be abnormal in brain neurones in Parkinson's disease. 
The low dopamine content in the basal ganglia and in the urine of patients with Parkinson's disease led to the logical use of the precursor DOPA in the treatment of this disorder. 
This hypothesis accounts for several clinical features of Parkinson's disease and predicts compounds which may be new therapeutic agents. 
It is suggested that these findings indicate a decreased rate of tyrosine utilization in Parkinson's disease together with intestinal malabsorption; the latter is supported by the finding of abnormal D-xylose tolerance in these patients.

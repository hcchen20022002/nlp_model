BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a lethal malignancy
without effective treatment options. MLN0128, a second generation pan-mTOR
inhibitor, shows efficacy for multiple tumor types. We evaluated the therapeutic 
potential of MLN0128 vs. gemcitabine/oxaliplatin in a novel ICC mouse model.
METHODS: We established a novel ICC mouse model via hydrodynamic transfection of 
activated forms of AKT (myr-AKT) and Yap (YapS127A) protooncogenes (that will be 
referred to as AKT/YapS127A). Genetic approaches were applied to study the
requirement of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in mediating AKT/YapS127A driven tumorigenesis. 
Gemcitabine/oxaliplatin and MLN0128 were administered in AKT/YapS127A
tumor-bearing mice to study their anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Multiple human ICC
cell lines were used for in vitro experiments. Hematoxylin and eosin staining,
immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were applied for the characterization and
mechanistic study.
RESULTS: Co-expression of myr-AKT and YapS127A promoted ICC development in mice. 
Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes were required for AKT/YapS127A ICC development. 
Gemcitabine/oxaliplatin had limited efficacy in treating late stage AKT/YapS127A 
ICC. In contrast, partial tumor regression was achieved when MLN0128 was applied 
in the late stage of AKT/YapS127A cholangiocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, when
MLN0128 was administered in the early stage of AKT/YapS127A carcinogenesis, it
led to disease stabilization. Mechanistically, MLN0128 efficiently inhibited
AKT/mTOR signaling both in vivo and in vitro, inducing strong ICC cell apoptosis 
and only marginally affecting proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that mTOR kinase inhibitors may be beneficial
for the treatment of ICC, even in tumors that are resistant to standard of care
chemotherapeutics, such as gemcitabine/oxaliplatin-based regimens, especially in 
the subset of tumors exhibiting activated AKT/mTOR cascade. Lay summary: We
established a novel mouse model of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Using
this new preclinical model, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of mTOR
inhibitor MLN0128 vs. gemcitabine/oxaliplatin (the standard chemotherapy for ICC 
treatment). Our study shows the anti-neoplastic potential of MLN0128, suggesting 
that it may be superior to gemcitabine/oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for the
treatment of ICC, especially in the tumors exhibiting activated AKT/mTOR cascade.

INTRODUCTION: The prognosis of primary liver cancer (PLC) remains poor and is
explained by the slow progress in understanding the molecular pathways driving
tumorigenesis, therapeutic resistance and relapse. For early PLCs, complete
surgical resection is the only effective treatment, with sorafenib and, more
recently, regorafenib prolonging overall survival by a few months. Areas covered:
Application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), including targeted NGS (tNGS),
whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing
(RNAseq), on clinical samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) could aid in comprehending
tumorigenesis, genetic and genomic heterogeneity, as well as developing molecular
classifications for specialized targeted therapy. Expert commentary: Despite the 
many overenthusiastic original and opinion reports, we have critically reviewed
available NGS studies, with focus on the challenges to achieve clinical
implications. Based on the recommendations for valid identification of clinically
crucial genomic alterations (GAs) by NGS, we propose NGS integration into
appropriately designed clinical trials. Furthermore, valid detection of genomic
heterogeneity enables the conduction of clinical trials investigating the
efficacy both of GAs as prognostic and predictive tools, as well as the discovery
of novel oncotargets, on the basis of an early drug development strategy.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a relatively rare form of liver cancer
with a poor prognosis. The therapeutic options for patients with advanced ICC are
limited and usually ineffective. There is currently no approved targeted therapy 
for ICC, although accumulating evidence supports inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ICC.
Here, we report a patient with stage IV ICC harboring a PIK3CA mutation who
responded well to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging demonstrated shrinkage of the tumor and maintenance of a
partial response for 6.5 mo after everolimus treatment as the best response. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical case report in the
literature of clinical benefit from everolimus treatment in an ICC patient with
PIK3CA mutation.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has been increasing in
recent years and now represents the second most common primary hepatic cancer in 
the United States. The prognosis is dismal without surgical resection. In
patients ineligible to receive curative treatments, locoregional therapies
represent a diverse array of techniques that can stabilize or reverse tumor
progression to improve overall survival and reduce tumor-related symptoms.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and transarterial radioembolization (TARE)
have been demonstrated to be efficacious methods for this patient population.
Deciding between these two options is challenging. This article reviews the
differences in patient selection, preprocedural evaluation, financial
considerations and availability, quality of life, and rates of complications and 
overall survival.

Patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have a poor
prognosis and the therapeutic options available for treating ICC are limited.
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
2 and 3, platelet derived growth factor receptor-β, B-Raf proto-oncogene,
serine/threonine kinase and C-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, is a
novel reference standard for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Sorafenib has previously been demonstrated to exhibit significant antitumor
activity in various cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and in xenograft ICC models.
The present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sorafenib as a
single-agent treatment in patients with advanced ICC. Eligible patients were
administere no prior therapy for metastatic or unresectable disease. Sorafenib
was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice daily continuously. The primary
endpoint was considered as the disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks. Secondary 
endpoints included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS),
overall survival (OS), duration of treatment (DOT) and the adverse event profile.
A total of 15 patients were enrolled in the present study, with a median DOT of
3.2 months (range, 1.5-30 months). A total of 4 patients achieved a partial
response and 7 patients achieved stable disease, with a DCR of 73.3%. The median 
OS time was 5.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0-6.4], the PFS time was 
5.5 months (95% CI, 3.9-7.1) and the median TTP was 3.2 months (range, 1.5-29
months). The most common toxicity was a skin rash, which w1as observed in 5
patients (33.3%). Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome was observed in 1 patient (6.7%),
which required treatment termination. The results of the present study suggest
that sorafenib monotherapy may exhibit promising anticancer activity in patients 
with advanced ICC and that it has a manageable toxicity profile.

AIM: To report clinical outcomes of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using 
drug-eluting beads (DEBs) loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of
unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 127 patients with doxorubicin via TACE.
Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of unresectable CCA; indication for TACE,
performance status (PS) 0-2, >3 months of life expectancy, >18 years old, written
consent. TACE was performed using DEBs for 109 (86%) patients and polythylene
glycol drug-elutable microspheres (PEG) loaded with doxorubicin for 18 (14%)
patients.
RESULTS: Tumor response of the whole sample of 127 patients was partial response 
(PR) in 19 (15%) patients, stable disease (SD) in 101 (80%) and progressive
disease (PD) in seven (5%) 3 months after therapy, with no complete responses.
There were differences between type of embolics: PR was 7% and 77%, SD was 88%
and 8%, and PD was 5% and 15%, and the disease control rate was 95% and 85% in
the DEB and PEG groups, respectively. Most frequent side-effects were: abdominal 
pain, fever, nausea, and transaminase rise.
CONCLUSION: TACE was effective and safe for CCA treatment, with a high disease
control rate. The best response of PEG-TACE was PR, whereas it was SD for
DEB-TACE.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In 2010 we published that 53% of cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detected in Spain were diagnosed outside the
context of standard screening programs, which consequently leads to lower
survival rates. The aim of this study was to analyze the current situation and
the causes of diagnosis out of screening programs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective registry of 73 second- and third-level Spanish 
healthcare centers carried out between October 1, 2014 and January 31, 2015. The 
baseline characteristics of the disease and the first treatment administered for 
the incidental primary liver tumors during such period were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 720 patients were included in the study: HCC (n=686),
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n=29), hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n=2), other
(n=3). HCC characteristics: male 82%; mean age 67 years; cirrhosis 87%; main
etiologies: alcohol 35%, HCV 30%, alcohol and HCV 15%, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease 6%; tumor stage: BCLC-0 11%, A 43%, B 19%, C 16% and D 11%; first
treatment: transarterial chemoembolization (23%), percutaneous ablation (22%),
symptomatic treatment (20%), resection (11%), sorafenib (11%). Three hundred and 
fifty-six patients (53%) were diagnosed outside of screening programs, mainly
owing to the fact that they suffered from an undiagnosed liver disease (76%) and 
to the poor adherence to the screening program (18%). These patients were mainly 
male (P<.001), with an alcoholic etiology (P<.001) and active alcohol consumption
(P<.001). Moreover, the disease was predominantly diagnosed at more advanced
stages (P<.001) and was addressed with less radical treatments (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, the main cause of diagnosis of a HCC outside the context
of a screening program is the absence of a prior diagnosis of a liver disease,
particularly in alcohol-consuming men. Detecting a liver disease in asymptomatic 
populations and improving adherence to screening programs are the main areas that
must be subject to improvement in order to improve the early detection of HCC.

future prospects.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare disease and carries a poor
prognosis with surgery remaining the only curative treatment option. However, due
to the late presentation of symptoms and close proximity of the tumors to central
hepatic structures, only about 30% of patients are classified eligible to
resection. As for palliative approaches, ICC constitutes a possible indication
for loco-regional therapies (LRT). As such, intra-arterial therapies (IAT) are
reported to be feasible, safe and effective in inducing tumor response in
unresectable ICC. The paradigm of IAT is premised on the selective delivery of
embolic, chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor via its feeding arteries, thus
allowing dose escalation within the carcinoma and reduction of systemic toxicity.
Conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) so far remains the 
most commonly used IAT modality. However, drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE was
initiated with the idea of more selective targeting of the tumor owing to the
combined embolizing as well as drug-eluting properties of the microspheres used
in this setting. Moreover, radioembolization is performed by intra-arterial
administration of very small spheres containing β-emitting yttrium-90 (Y90-RE) to
the site of the tumor. Clinical evidence exists in support of survival benefits
for IAT in the palliative treatment of ICC compared to surgery and systemic
chemotherapy. As for combination regimens, cTACE, DEB-TACE and Y90-RE are
reported to achieve conversion of patients to surgery in a sequential treatment
planning and simultaneous IAT combinations may provide a therapeutic option for
treatment escalation. Regarding the current status of literature, controlled
randomized prospective trials to compare different IAT techniques and combination
therapies as well as treatment recommendations for different IAT modalities are
needed.

BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is the second most primary liver malignancy
with increasing incidence in Western countries. Currently, surgical R0 resection 
is regarded as the only potentially curative treatment. The results of systemic
chemotherapy and best supportive care (BSC) in patients with metastatic disease
are often disappointing in regard to toxicity, oncologic efficacy, and overall
survival. In current practice, the use of different locoregional therapies is
increasingly more accepted.
METHODS: A review of the literature on locoregional therapies for intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) was undertaken.
RESULTS: There are no prospective randomized controlled trials. For localized
ICC, either primary or recurrent, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is by far the
most commonly used thermal ablation modality. Thereby, a systematic review and
meta-analysis reports major complication in 3.8% as well as 1-, 3-, and 5-year
overall survival rates of 82, 47, and 24%, respectively. In selected patients
(e.g. with a tumor diameter of ≤3 cm), oncologic efficacy and survival after RFA 
are comparable with surgical resection. For diffuse ICC, different transarterial 
therapies, either chemotherapy-based (hepatic artery infusion (HAI),
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)) or radiotherapy-based (transarterial
radioembolization (TARE)), show extremely promising results. With regard to
controlled trials (transarterial therapy versus systemic chemotherapy, BSC or no 
treatment), tumor control is virtually always better for transarterial therapies 
and very often accompanied by a dramatic survival benefit and improvement of
quality of life. Of note, the latter is the case not only for patients without
extrahepatic metastatic disease but also for those with liver-dominant
extrahepatic metastatic disease. There are other locoregional therapies such as
microwave ablation, irreversible electroporation, and chemosaturation; however,
the current data support their use only in controlled trials or as last-line
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Dedicated locoregional therapies are commonly used for primary and
recurrent ICC as well as liver-only and liver-dominant extrahepatic metastatic
disease. Currently, the best evidence and most promising results are available
for RFA, HAI, TACE, and TARE. In cohort studies, the overall survival rates are
similar to those obtained with surgery or systemic therapies. Prospective
randomized controlled trials are warranted to compare safety and efficacy between
different surgical, interventional, and systemic therapies, as well as their
combinations.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze the postoperative outcomes for patients
with recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and to determine the
prognostic factors. In addition, this study investigated the effects of various
treatment methods for patients with recurrent ICC.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the postoperative outcomes and
prognostic factors of recurrent ICC that occurred for 81 of 128 patients who
underwent hepatic resection for ICC between April 2001 and April 2013. In
addition, the outcomes for a number of treatment methods were assessed for
patients with recurrent ICC.
RESULTS: After resection, the 128 patients with ICC had survival rates of 73 % at
1 year, 52 % at 3 years, and 43 % at 5 years. Recurrent ICC developed in 81
patients (56 men and 25 women) with a median age of 63 years. The median time
from initial resection to recurrence was 9 months (range, 0-124 months), and the 
median survival time after recurrence was 8 months (range, 0-108 months). After
recurrence, the overall survival rates were 47 % at 1 year, 23 % at 3 years, and 
15 % at 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed disease-free survival time shorter 
than 1 year and bile duct invasion to be significant prognostic factors. Among
the treatment methods, local management such as surgery, transarterial
chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation were effective in select cases
with localized intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Active local treatment (i.e., surgery, transarterial
chemoembolization [TACE], and radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) may improve survival
for patients with localized ICC recurrence.

Patients with unresectable and advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
usually have short survival due to a lack of effective treatment. This
multicenter, single arm, open labeled, prospective study was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness and safety of sorafenib combined with best supportive 
care (BSC) in these patients. We enrolled 44 patients with unresectable and
advanced ICC who were treated with sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) and BSC. The
primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR) at week 12, and the secondary
endpoints included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS),
overall survival (OS), duration of therapy (DOT), and adverse events (AEs). Our
results showed that the DCR was 15.9%, the median TTP was 5.6 months, and the
median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 5.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-4.1 
months; 3.7-8.5 months), respectively. The median DOT was 1.8 months (95% CI:
1.9-3.9 months). AEs of grades 1 and 2 events occurred in 75% of patients, and AE
of grade 4 (severe) was observed in 1 patient. Therefore, sorafenib in
combination with BSC had an acceptable DCR and safety profile in patients with
unresectable and advanced ICC.

BACKGROUND: The postoperative prognosis of patients with intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is far from satisfactory. Whether postoperative adjuvant
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is effective for patients with
ICC after R0 liver resection remains controversial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 272 patients with 
ICC who received a radical hepatectomy at our center between 2000 and 2011. After
the propensity score of postoperative TACE was calculated, 75 patients who
received TACE were matched at a 1:2 ratios with 150 patients who did not receive 
TACE. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to identify the
independent predictors of overall survival.
RESULTS: The postoperative protective effect of adjuvant TACE was significantly
influenced by serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (P for
interaction = 0.026). Postoperative TACE was not a significant predictor of
overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.89, P = 0.704) in patients with GGT
levels ≤ 54 U/L. Postoperative TACE was a significant predictor of overall
survival in patients with GGT levels >54 U/L (hazard ratio = 0.44, P = 0.001).
Regarding short-term outcomes, a total of 74 patients (32.9%) had varying degrees
of complications, and the majority of these complications were grade I (18.7%) or
II (10.2%).
CONCLUSION: The safety of postoperative TACE was validated, and the results
suggest that only patients with elevated serum GGT levels will benefit from this 
treatment following curative liver resection for ICC.

BACKGROUND: Certain anticancer drugs are known to induce leg ulcers, mainly
chemotherapy agents such as hydroxyurea. We report 2 cases of leg ulcers in
cancer patients treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and
nilotinib, and we discuss the role of these treatments in the pathogenesis of leg
ulcers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case 1. A 62-year-old patient on sunitinib for intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma developed a lesion on her right foot. The vascular evaluation 
was negative. After progressive worsening, sunitinib was stopped and healing was 
observed within a few months. Case 2. A 83-year-old patient had been treated for 
chronic myeloid leukemia since 2005. Nilotinib was introduced in 2009. Peripheral
arterial revascularization was required in May 2013. A few months later,
worsening was noted with the onset of ulceration and necrosis of the third toe.
Further revascularisation surgery was performed, and nilotinib was suspended and 
antiplatelets introduced. Healing occurred a few months later.
DISCUSSION: Many skin reactions have been described in patients on nilotinib and 
sunitinib, but few publications report the development of de novo ulcers in
patients without risk factors. The pathophysiology of the development of ulcers
in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors is not clear, and probably
involves several mechanisms of action. The increasing use of this type of
treatment could lead to an upsurge in the incidence of vascular complications.
CONCLUSION: We report two cases of leg ulcers developing in patients on tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors and raise the question of causal implication of these
treatments in the pathogenesis of ulcers.

Double primary liver cancer (DPLC) is a special type of clinical situation. As
such, a detailed analysis of the surgical management and prognosis of patients
with DPLC is lacking. The objective of the current study was to define the
management and outcome of patients undergoing surgery for DPLC at a major
hepatobiliary center.A total of 87 patients treated by surgical resection at the 
Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital from January 1st, 2007 to October 31st,
2013 who had DPLC demonstrated by final pathological diagnosis were identified.
Among these, 50 patients had complete clinical and prognostic data. Demographic
and tumor characteristics as well as the prognosis were analyzed.The proportion
of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (+) and hepatitis B virus e antigen
(HBeAg) (+), HBsAg (+), and HBeAg (-) hepatocirrhosis in all patients was 21.84%,
67.82%, and 63.22%, respectively. Incidental findings accounted for 58.62% of
patients; among those who had symptoms, the main symptom was abdominal pain
(31.03%). Nonanatomic wedge resection was the main operative approach (62.07%).
Postoperatively, the main complications included seroperitoneum (11.49%),
hypoproteinemia (10.34%), and pleural effusion (8.05%). Factors associated with
disease-free survival (DFS) included intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) tumor 
size (P = 0.002) and use of postoperative prophylactic transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization (TACE) treatment (P = 0.015). Meanwhile, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) size (P = 0.045), ICC size (P < 0.001), and liver function
(including aspartate aminotransferase [P = 0.001] and r-glutamyl transferase
[P < 0.001]) were associated with overall survival (OS).Hepatitis B virus
(HBV)-related hepatitis or cirrhosis is also an important factor in the
pathogenesis of DPLC and surgical treatment is safe for it with low complication 
rates. In addition, it is effective to prolong DFS that DPLC patients undergo
postoperative prophylactic TACE treatment.

Although surgical resection is the only way to cure biliary tract cancer (BTC),
most BTCs are unresectable by the time they are diagnosed. Chemotherapy is
usually used to treat unresectable BTC, but its impact on survival is small.
Here, we report the case of a 70-year-old woman with a locally advanced
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma that was initially diagnosed as an unresectable
liver metastasis from colon cancer that had invaded all of the major hepatic
veins. However, the tumor was noticeably reduced after treatment with CAPOX plus 
bevacizumab, which is an uncommon therapy for BTC. The tumor was finally resected
by inferior right hepatic vein-preserving left hepatic trisectionectomy combined 
with a resection of the right hepatic vein after a right hepatic vein
embolization.

BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare malignant tumor. The 
etiology of ICC remains poorly understood. Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection has been implicated as a potential risk factor for ICC, particularly in
HBV-endemic areas. Elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is seen in
approximately 20 % of ICC patients. However, serum AFP levels higher than
10,000 ng/mL have only been reported in a few ICC patients. We report an unusual 
case of HBV-associated ICC occurring in a male with a markedly elevated serum
AFP.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old East Asian male presented with complaints of
epigastric distention and right shoulder pain. Laboratory tests showed HBV
infection, HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) slightly elevated (21 IU/mL) and serum
AFP markedly elevated (12,310 ng/mL). Computed tomography (CT) scan found a large
and irregular mass in the left lobe of the liver. The patient underwent the left 
hepatic lobe resection. Histopathological examination showed chronic hepatitis B 
in the background liver and the immunohistochemical (IHC) findings strongly
supported the diagnosis of ICC with aberrant expression of AFP. Serum AFP and HBV
DNA declined to normal level postoperatively. The patient received four cycles of
gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and took entecavir to prevent HBV reactivation. The 
patient kept disease free for 18 months in the latest follow-up.
CONCLUSION: ICC patients with HBV infection should be distinguished from other
ICC cases, based on distinct clinicopathological features and favorable outcome. 
Screening for HBV infection should be carried out before initiation of
chemotherapy. Antiviral therapy is indicated for prevention of HBV reactivation.

BACKGROUND: Primary liver and biliary cancers are very aggressive tumors.
Surgical treatment is the main option for cure or long term survival. The main
purpose of this systematic review is to underline the indications for portal vein
embolization (PVE), in patients with inadequate future liver remnant (FLR) and to
analyze other parameters such as resection rate, morbidity, mortality, survival
after PVE and hepatectomy for primary hepatobiliary tumors. Also the role of
trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) before PVE, is investigated.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed in Pub Med and the
Cochrane Library from 01.01.1990 to 30.09.2015.
RESULTS: Forty articles were selected, including 2144 patients with a median age 
of 61 years. The median excision rate was 90% for hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCCs) and 86% for hilar cholangiocarcinomas (HCs). The main indications for PVE 
in patients with HCC and presence of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was FLR <40%
when liver function was good (ICGR15 < 10%) and FLR < 50% when liver function was
affected (ICGR15:10-20%). The combination of TACE and PVE increased hypertrophy
rate and was associated with better overall survival and disease free survival
and should be considered in advanced HCC tumors with inadequate FLR. In patients 
with HCs PVE was performed, after preoperative biliary drainage, when FLR was
<40%, in the majority of studies, with very good post-operative outcome. However 
indications should be refined.
CONCLUSION: PVE before major hepatectomy allows resection in a patient group with
advanced primary hepato-biliary tumors and inadequate FLR, with good long term
survival.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive liver bile duct malignancy
exhibiting frequent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/IDH2) mutations. Through a
high-throughput drug screen of a large panel of cancer cell lines, including 17
biliary tract cancers, we found that IDH mutant (IDHm) ICC cells demonstrate a
striking response to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, with the highest
sensitivity among 682 solid tumor cell lines. Using unbiased proteomics to
capture the activated kinome and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to introduce
dasatinib-resistant "gatekeeper" mutant kinases, we identified SRC as a critical 
dasatinib target in IDHm ICC. Importantly, dasatinib-treated IDHm xenografts
exhibited pronounced apoptosis and tumor regression. Our results show that IDHm
ICC cells have a unique dependency on SRC and suggest that dasatinib may have
therapeutic benefit against IDHm ICC. Moreover, these proteomic and
genome-editing strategies provide a systematic and broadly applicable approach to
define targets of kinase inhibitors underlying drug responsiveness.SIGNIFICANCE: 
IDH mutations define a distinct subtype of ICC, a malignancy that is largely
refractory to current therapies. Our work demonstrates that IDHm ICC cells are
hypersensitive to dasatinib and critically dependent on SRC activity for survival
and proliferation, pointing to new therapeutic strategies against these cancers.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly lethal cancer with limited therapeutic options.
Recent genomic analysis of cholangiocarcinoma has revealed the presence of
fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins in up to 13% of
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). FGFR fusions have been identified as a
novel oncogenic and druggable target in a number of cancers. In this study, we
established a novel cholangiocarcinoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse
model bearing an FGFR2-CCDC6 fusion protein from a metastatic lung nodule of an
iCCA patient. Using this PDX model, we confirmed the ability of the FGFR
inhibitors, ponatinib, dovitinib and BGJ398, to modulate FGFR signaling, inhibit 
cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma tumors
harboring FGFR2 fusions. In addition, BGJ398 appeared to be superior in potency
to ponatinib and dovitinib in this model. Our findings provide a strong rationale
for the investigation of FGFR inhibitors, particularly BGJ398, as a therapeutic
option for cholangiocarcinoma patients harboring FGFR2 fusions.

Tumor cells co-express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF
receptors (VEGFRs) that interact each other to support a self-sustainable cell
growth. So far, this autocrine VEGF loop is not reported in human intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, but
its effects on ICC have not been investigated. In this study, we reported that
VEGF and phosphorylated VEGFR2 were expressed at a significantly high level in
ICC patient tissues (P<0.05). In vitro, treating ICC cell lines RBE and SSP25
with recombinant human VEGF (rhVEGF) induced phosphorylation of VEGFR1 (pVEGFR1) 
and VEGFR2 (pVEGFR2); however, only the VEGFR2 played a role in the
anti-apoptotic cell growth through activating a PI3K-AKT-mTOR anti-apoptotic
signaling pathway which generated more VEGF to enter this autocrine loop.
Apatinib inhibited the anti-apoptosis induced by VEGF signaling, and promoted
cell death in vitro. In addition, Apatinib treatment delayed xenograft tumor
growth in vivo. In conclusion, the autocrine VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling promotes ICC
cell survival. Apatinib inhibits anti-apoptotic cell growth through suppressing
the autocrine VEGF signaling, supporting a potential role for using Apatinib in
the treatment of ICC.

Aim. To assess the outcomes of patients with unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) treated by a tailored therapeutic approach,
combining systemic with advanced image-guided local or locoregional therapies.
Materials and Methods. Treatment followed an algorithm established by a
multidisciplinary GI-tumor team. Treatment options comprised ablation (RFA,
CT-guided brachytherapy) or locoregional techniques (TACE, radioembolization,
i.a. chemotherapy). Results. Median survival was 33.1 months from time of
diagnosis and 16.0 months from first therapy. UICC stage analysis showed a median
survival of 15.9 months for stage I, 9 months for IIIa, 18.4 months for IIIc, and
13 months for IV. Only the number of lesions, baseline serum CEA and serum
CA19-9, and objective response (RECIST) were independently associated with
survival. Extrahepatic metastases had no influence. Conclusion. Patients with
unresectable ICC may benefit from hepatic tumor control provided by local or
locoregional therapies. Future prospective study formats should focus on
supplementing systemic therapy by classes of interventions ("toolbox") rather
than specific techniques, that is, local ablation leading to complete tumor
destruction (such as RFA) or locoregional treatment leading to partial remission 
(such as radioembolization). This trial is registered with German Clinical Trials
Registry (Deutsche Register Klinischer Studien), DRKS-ID: DRKS00006237.

Biphenotypic (hepatobiliary) primary liver carcinomas [B(H-B)PLCs] are rare
tumors with features of both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). These tumors are associated with a poor overall
prognosis and treatment is not well defined. Research over the past 20 years has 
identified aberrations in several molecular pathways, including epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in
hepatocellular and biliary tract cancers. These discoveries led to the evaluation
of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for the treatment of
HCC and ICC. We report a case of a patient with metastatic B(H-B)PLC found to
have a single nucleotide variant in the EGFR gene locus R521K who achieved a
complete response on imaging after treatment with the combination of an EGFR
inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor. This case prompts consideration of further
genomic analysis of these rare tumors and the potential use of targeted therapies
in the treatment of patients with B(H-B)PLCs.

We investigated the sensitivity of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCA)
subtypes to chemotherapeutics and molecular targeted agents. Primary cultures of 
mucin- and mixed-IHCCA were prepared from surgical specimens (N. 18 IHCCA
patients) and evaluated for cell proliferation (MTS assay) and apoptosis (Caspase
3) after incubation (72 hours) with increasing concentrations of different drugs.
In vivo, subcutaneous human tumor xenografts were evaluated. Primary cultures of 
mucin- and mixed-IHCCA were characterized by a different pattern of expression of
cancer stem cell markers, and by a different drug sensitivity. Gemcitabine and
the Gemcitabine-Cisplatin combination were more active in inhibiting cell
proliferation in mixed-IHCCA while Cisplatin or Abraxane were more effective
against mucin-IHCCA, where Abraxane also enhances apoptosis. 5-Fluoracil showed a
slight inhibitory effect on cell proliferation that was more significant in
mixed- than mucin-IHCCA primary cultures and, induced apoptosis only in
mucin-IHCCA. Among Hg inhibitors, LY2940680 and Vismodegib showed slight effects 
on proliferation of both IHCCA subtypes. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Imatinib
Mesylate and Sorafenib showed significant inhibitory effects on proliferation of 
both mucin- and mixed-IHCCA. The MEK 1/2 inhibitor, Selumetinib, inhibited
proliferation of only mucin-IHCCA while the aminopeptidase-N inhibitor, Bestatin 
was more active against mixed-IHCCA. The c-erbB2 blocking antibody was more
active against mixed-IHCCA while, the Wnt inhibitor, LGK974, similarly inhibited 
proliferation of mucin- and mixed-IHCCA. Either mucin- or mixed-IHCCA showed high
sensitivity to nanomolar concentrations of the dual PI3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor,
NVP-BEZ235. In vivo, in subcutaneous xenografts, either NVP-BEZ235 or Abraxane,
blocked tumor growth. In conclusion, mucin- and mixed-IHCCA are characterized by 
a different drug sensitivity. Cisplatin, Abraxane and the MEK 1/2 inhibitor,
Selumetinib were more active against mucin-IHCCA while, Gemcitabine,
Gemcitabine-Cisplatin combination, the c-erbB2 blocking antibody and bestatin
worked better against mixed-IHCCA. Remarkably, we identified a dual
PI3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor that both in vitro and in vivo, exerts dramatic
antiproliferative effects against both mucin- and mixed-IHCCA.

BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare and lethal disease with few
therapeutic options. Preclinical data suggest that the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) pathway could be involved in its progression.
METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial recruited chemotherapy-naive
patients with advanced BTC displaying a wild-type (WT) KRAS status. Patients were
randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) ) with
(arm A) or without (arm B) panitumumab (6 mg/kg) for up to 12 cycles. The primary
endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) analyzed in an intention-to-treat
fashion.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (45 in arm A and 44 in arm B) were enrolled between
June 2010 and September 2013. After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the median
PFS was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3.3-7.2 months) in arm A and 4.4
months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.2 months) in arm B (P = .27). No survival 
differences were observed: the median overall survival was 9.9 months in arm A
and 10.2 months in arm B (P = .42). In a subgroup analysis, no differences in PFS
according to the site of the primary tumor were observed; patients with
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with panitumumab may have had a survival 
benefit in comparison with the control group (15.1 vs 11.8 months, P = .13). As
for safety, skin toxicity was the main adverse event in arm A (80% of the
patients). A higher incidence of diarrhea (55.5% vs 31.8%), mucositis (22.2% vs
13.6%), and constipation (24.4% vs 15.9%) was seen in arm A.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the marginal role of anti-EGFR therapy even
for WT KRAS-selected BTC.

Intrahepatic chemotherapy for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma: review of
literature and personal experience.

Massani M, Nistri C, Ruffolo C, Bonariol R, Pauletti B, Bonariol L, Caratozzolo
E, Morana G, Bassi N.

Most patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCA) are unresectable and 
treatment options are limited. This study evaluates the efficacy of hepatic
artery infusion (HAI) chemotherapy in patients whose disease is not initially
treatable with resection. We selected patients with unresectable IH-CCA treated
only with HAI chemotherapy at our centre between January 2008 and December 2012. 
We compared our outcome, using mRECIST, with published results of patients
treated with systemic chemotherapy during the same period. Eleven patients
underwent HAI chemotherapy with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin after placement of
an HAI pump. A CT scan performed after the sixth cycle of therapy revealed that 5
of them had partial hepatic response (more than 45 %), 2 stable disease and 4
showed clear signs of disease progression. The average survival of the entire
group was 17.6 months. Three of the patients with partial hepatic response
underwent resection and 2 had more than 70 % tumour necrosis, both of whom are
still alive and disease free. The median survival of patients with liver-only
disease treated with systemic chemotherapy, who were not submitted for resection,
was 15.3 months. HAI chemotherapy enables this small group of patients to have
their unresectable IH-CCA disease converted into a resectable one, thus
confirming its role in treatment of this disease.

AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided
percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) combined with simultaneous transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
METHODS: All patients treated with ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA combined
with simultaneous TACE for advanced ICC at our institution were included.
Posttreatment contrast-enhanced computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance
imaging were retrieved and reviewed for tumor response to the treatment. Routine 
laboratory studies, including hematology and liver function tests were collected 
and analyzed. Procedure-related complications were reviewed and survival rates
were analyzed.
RESULTS: From January 2011 to December 2014, a total of 26 advanced ICC patients 
were treated at our single institute with ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA
combined with simultaneous TACE. There were 15 males and eleven females with an
average age of 57.9±10.4 years (range, 43-75 years). Of 26 patients, 20 (76.9%)
patients were newly diagnosed advanced ICC without any treatment, and six (23.1%)
were recurrent and treated with surgical resection of the original tumor. The
complete ablation rate was 92.3% (36/39 lesions) for advanced ICC. There were no 
major complications observed. There was no death directly from the treatment.
Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.2 and 19.5 months,
respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month survival rates were 88.5%, 69.2%, and
61.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that ultrasound-guided percutaneous MWA combined
with simultaneous TACE therapy can be performed safely in all patients with
advanced ICC. The complete ablation rate was high and there was no major
complication. The overall 24-month survival was 61.5%.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) after hepatectomy remains unclear. This
study was performed to identify ICC patients who would benefit from adjuvant
TACE.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 553 patients who underwent hepatectomy
for ICC between January 2008 and February 2011 at the Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital and who were treated with or without TACE (122 with TACE and 431
without TACE). Survival risk stratification was performed using the established
prognostic nomogram (ICC nomogram). The predictive performance was evaluated by
concordance index and calibration. The tumor recurrence and overall survival (OS)
rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method before and after propensity score 
matching (PSM).
RESULTS: The predictive performance of the ICC nomogram was demonstrated by the
well-fitted calibration curves and an optimal c-index of 0.71 for OS prediction. 
In the whole cohort, the 5-year recurrence and OS rates between the TACE and
non-TACE groups were significantly different (5-year recurrence: 72.9% vs. 78.1%;
OS: 38.4% vs. 29.7%). After 1:1 PSM, the TACE and non-TACE groups (122 patients
each) had similar 5-year recurrence and OS rates (5-year recurrence: 72.9% vs.
74.2%; OS: 38.4% vs. 36.0%). By survival risk stratification based on ICC
nomogram, only the patients in the lowest tertile (nomogram scores ≥77) benefited
from adjuvant TACE (TACE vs. non-TACE groups: 90.4% vs. 95.9% for 5-year
recurrence; 21.3% vs. 6.2% for 5-year OS).
CONCLUSION: Adjuvant TACE following liver resection might be suitable for ICC
patients with high ICC nomogram scores (≥77).
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The accurate predictive performance of the established
prognostic nomogram for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) following liver
resection was reconfirmed in an independent cohort with 553 patients. Based on
the survival risk stratification using the nomogram, adjuvant transarterial
chemoembolization following liver resection might be suitable only for ICC
patients with high scores from the nomogram.

Advanced cholangiocarcinoma is associated with poor prognostic survival and has
limited therapeutic options available at present. The importance of angiogenesis 
and expression of pro-angiogenic factors in intrahepatic forms of
cholangiocarcinoma suggest that therapies targeting angiogenesis might be useful 
for the treatment of this disease. Here we report three cases of patients with
advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progressive after standard chemotherapy 
and treated with sunitinib 50 mg/d in 6-wk cycles of 4 wk on treatment followed
by 2 wk off treatment (Schedule 4/2). In all three patients, sunitinib treatment 
was associated with a sustained disease control superior to 4 mo, patients
achieving either a partial response or stable disease. A reduction in tumor size 
and density was observed in all cases, suggesting tumor necrosis as a result of
sunitinib treatment in these patients. In addition, sunitinib was generally well 
tolerated and the occurrence of side effects was managed with standard medical
interventions, as required. Our results suggest that sunitinib therapy may be
associated with favorable outcomes and tolerability in patients with advanced
cholangiocarcinoma. Those observations contributed to launch a prospective phase 
II multicenter trial investigating sunitinib in advanced intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (SUN-CK study; NCT01718327).

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab treatment
outcome as second-line treatment for metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients with metastatic intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma who were refractory to first-line therapy consisting of
gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy given intravenously
via intra-arterial infusion were treated with FOLFIRI [irinotecan (180 mg/m² i.v.
over 90 min) concurrently with folinic acid (400 mg/m² i.v. over 120 min)
followed by fluorouracil (400 mg/m² i.v. bolus) then fluorouracil 2400 mg/m²
intravenous infusion over 46 h] and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 wk. Tumor
response was evaluated by computed tomography scan every 4 cycles.
RESULTS: The best tumor responses using response evaluation criteria in solid
tumor criteria were: complete response for 1 patient, partial response for 4
patients, and stable disease for 6 patients after 6 mo of follow-up. The response
rate was 38.4% (95%CI: 12.5-89) and the disease control rate was 84.5% (95%CI:
42-100). Seven deaths occurred at the time of analysis, progression free survival
was 8 mo (95%CI: 7-16), and median overall survival was 20 mo (95%CI: 8-48). No
grade 4 toxic events were observed. Four grade 3 hematological toxicities and one
grade 3 digestive toxicity occurred. An adaptive reduction in chemotherapy dosage
was required in 2 patients due to hematological toxicity, and a delay in
chemotherapy cycles was required for 3 patients.
CONCLUSION: FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab combination treatment showed promising
efficacy and safety as second-line treatment for metastatic intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma after failure of the first-line treatment of gemcitabine plus 
oxaliplatin chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the detectability of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
on dual-phase cone-beam CT (DPCBCT) during conventional transarterial
chemoembolization (cTACE) compared to that of digital subtraction angiography
(DSA) with respect to pre-procedure contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging 
(CE-MRI) of the liver.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 17 consecutive patients (10 male, mean
age 64) with ICC who underwent pre-procedure CE-MRI of the liver, and DSA and
DPCBCT (early-arterial phase (EAP) and delayed-arterial phase (DAP)) just before 
cTACE. The visibility of each ICC lesion was graded by two radiologists on a
three-rank scale (complete, partial, and none) on DPCBCT and DSA images, and then
compared to pre-procedure CE-MRI.
RESULTS: Of 61 ICC lesions, only 45.9% were depicted by DSA, whereas EAP- and
DAP-CBCT yielded a significantly higher detectability rate of 73.8% and 93.4%,
respectively (p < 0.01). Out of the 33 lesions missed on DSA, 18 (54.5%) and 30
(90.9%) were revealed on EAP- and DAP-CBCT images, respectively. DSA depicted
only one lesion that was missed by DPCBCT due to streak artifacts caused by a
prosthetic mitral valve. DAP-CBCT identified significantly more lesions than
EAP-CBCT (p < 0.01). Conversely, EAP-CBCT did not detect lesions missed by
DAP-CBCT. For complete lesion visibility, DAP-CBCT yielded significantly higher
detectability (78.7%) compared to EAP (31.1%) and DSA (21.3%) (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: DPCBCT, and especially the DAP-CBCT, significantly improved the
detectability of ICC lesions during cTACE compared to DSA. We recommend the
routine use of DAP-CBCT in patients with ICC for per-procedure detectability and 
treatment planning in the setting of TACE.

Radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres offers an alternative treatment
option for patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
However, the rarity and heterogeneity of ICC makes it difficult to draw firm
conclusions about treatment efficacy. Therefore, the goal of the current study is
to systematically review the existing literature surrounding treatment of
unresectable ICCs with yttrium-90 microspheres and provide a comprehensive review
of the current experience and clinical outcome of this treatment modality. We
performed a comprehensive search of electronic databases for ICC treatment and
identified 12 studies with relevant data regarding radioembolization therapy with
yttrium-90 microspheres. Based on pooled analysis, the overall weighted median
survival was 15.5 months. Tumour response based on radiological studies
demonstrated a partial response in 28% and stable disease in 54% of patients at
three months. Seven patients were able to be downstaged to surgical resection.
The complication profile of radioembolization is similar to that of other
intra-arterial treatment modalities. Overall survival of patients with ICC after 
treatment with yttrium-90 microspheres is higher than historical survival rates
and shows similar survival to those patients treated with systemic chemotherapy
and/or trans-arterial chemoembolization therapy. Therefore, the use of yttrium-90
microspheres should be considered in the list of available treatment options for 
ICC. However, future randomized trials comparing systemic chemotherapy, TACE and 
local radiation will be required to identify the optimal treatment modality for
unresectable ICC.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemoimmunotherapy has been used to treat intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However, little is known about the phenomena underlying
the immunomodulation of ICC cells elicited by chemoimmunotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary ICC cells from a patient with ICC who received
gemcitabine followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), both combined with dendritic cells
pulsed with Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) peptides were cultured. ICC cells were treated
with gemcitabine, 5-FU or interferon (IFN)-γ in vitro. The phenotype of the ICC
cells was examined by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Stimulation of the ICC cells with gemcitabine resulted in up-regulation 
of WT1 mRNA, programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PDL1) and calreticulin.
Gemcitabine, 5-FU and IFN-γ induced up-regulation of mucin-1. Moreover, human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC, HLA-DR and PDL1 were extremely up-regulated by
IFN-γ.
CONCLUSION: Chemoimmunomodulating agents alter the immunogenicity of ICC cells,
resulting in complex clinical efficacy results.

Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery based therapies (HAT) are offered for patients with
unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). We aimed to evaluate the
comparative effectiveness of HAT -hepatic arterial infusion (HAI), transcatheter 
arterial chemoembolization (TACE), drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE), and
Yttrium(90) radioembolization (Y-90) for unresectable ICC.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed using a prospectively registered search
strategy at PROSPERO (CRD42013004830) that utilized PubMed (2003-2013). Primary
outcome was median overall survival (OS), and secondary outcomes were tumor
response to therapy and toxicity.
RESULTS: A total of 20 articles (of 793, n=657 patients) were selected for data
extraction. Highest Median OS was observed for HAI (22.8, 95% CI 9.8-35.8) months
versus Y90 (13.9, 9.5-18.3) months versus TACE (12.4, 10.9-13.9) months versus
DEB-TACE (12.3, 11-13.5) months. Response to therapy (complete and partial) was
highest for HAI (56.9%, 95%CI 41.0-72.8) versus Y90 (27.4%, 17.4-37.5) versus
TACE (17.3%, 6.8-27.8). The grade III/IV toxicity (Events per patient) was
highest for HAI (0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.48) versus TACE (0.26, 0.21-0.32) versus
DEB-TACE (0.32, 0.17-0.48).
CONCLUSION: For patients with unresectable ICC treated with HAT, HAI offered the 
best outcomes in terms of tumor response and survival but may be limited by
toxicity.

Systemic gemcitabine combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with
cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and isovorin for the treatment of advanced
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a pilot study.

Ishikawa T, Takami T, Segawa M, Yamaguchi Y, Uchida K, Terai S, Sakaida I.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a poor prognosis and
usually presents as advanced disease. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy
(HAIC) is a promising option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; however,
there have been few reports on the use of HAIC in patients with ICC. In the
present study, we investigated the efficacy of treatment with systemic
gemcitabine (GEM) combined with HAIC with cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), and isovorin in patients with advanced ICC.
METHODOLOGY: Seven patients with advanced ICC, who received systemic GEM combined
with HAIC with CDDP, 5-FU, and isovorin were studied.
RESULTS: The response rate after the first chemotherapy cycle was 57.1% (partial 
response, 4; stable disease, 2; progressive disease, 1). The cumulative survival 
rates at 1 and 2 years were 85.7% and 28.6%, respectively, and the median
survival time was 22.3 months. With regard to grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, the
percentages of patients developing leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
anemia, and anorexia were 28.6%, 28.6%, 42.9%, 14.3%, and 14.3%, respectively. Na
treatment-related deaths were encountered.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a pilot study, we suggest that systemic GEM
combined with HAIC with CDDP, 5-FU, and isovorin, may be a useful therapy for
patients with advanced ICC.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability
of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin as second-line
treatment for unresectable locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 12 consecutive
patients with unresectable locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
treated with HAI of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) over 30 min) followed by
oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) over 2 h), which was repeated every 2 weeks.
RESULTS: All patients presented with disease limited to the liver and all had
failed at least one line of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. The
best tumor responses using RECIST criteria were partial responses in 8 patients
and stable disease in 3 patients for at least 3 months; in 1 patient, disease
progressed, resulting in a disease control rate of 91% (95% CI 45-100%). The
median overall survival and time to progression were 9.1 months (95% CI 4.9-8.1) 
and 20.3 months (95% CI 13.2-49.7), respectively. Partial responses enabled R0
liver surgery in 2 patients and stereotactic radiation therapy in 3 patients.
Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia in 2 patients, thrombocytopenia in 2
patients, and oxaliplatin allergy in 2 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: HAI combining gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed promising efficacy 
and safety as second-line treatment for locally advanced intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma is categorized into intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). The prognosis
of ICC is far worse than that of ECC. In this pilot trial, the efficacy of
hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
combined with subcutaneous administration of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b 
in patients with advanced ICC was evaluated.
METHODS: The subjects were 20 advanced ICC patients treated using subcutaneous
PEG-IFNα-2b (50-100 μg on day 1 of every week, for 4 weeks) and intra-arterial
infusion of 5-FU (250 mg/day for 5 h on days 1-5 of every week, for 4 weeks). One
treatment cycle lasted 4 weeks. Therapy was discontinued in patients with
progressive disease (PD). For responses other than PD, treatment was repeated for
≥1 cycle.
RESULTS: The objective early response rate was 60.0 %. Cumulative survival rates 
were 71.6 % at 6 months, 53.7 % at 12 months, 28.6 % at 18 months, and 14.3 % at 
24 months. Median survival time was 14.6 months. All adverse reactions were
controllable by temporary suspension of treatment. Serious complications and
treatment-related deaths were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of PEG-IFNα-2b and 5-FU for advanced ICC
seems not to be worse than the results of the previous studies. Furthermore, most
adverse effects are transient and well tolerated. Based on the present findings, 
this combination therapy may be useful for patients with advanced ICC as one of
the therapeutic option.

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent of the biguanide family, which is
used first-line for type II diabetes with few side-effects. A recent
epidemiological study that included 1,828 potential intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients showed that metformin use was significantly
associated with a 60% reduction in ICC risk in diabetic patients, demonstrating
the potential value of metformin in ICC management. In the present study, we
firstly showed that metformin exhibited a dose- and time-dependent
anti-proliferation effect on ICC cell lines, by mechanisms including apoptosis
induction and cell cycle arrest. Metformin targeted the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway in
ICC cells. Furthermore, metformin sensitized ICC cells to certain
chemotherapeutic agents, such as sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil and As2O3 by targeting
the AMPK/mTOR/HIF-1α/MRP1 pathway and ERK. As it is an inexpensive and widely
used antidiabetic drug without severe adverse effects, metformin may be a
prospective chemotherapeutic agent or a chemosensitizer in future ICC treatment.

The Notch signaling pathway has been reported to play crucial roles in inhibiting
hepatocyte differentiation and allowing formation of intrahepatic bile ducts.
However, little is known about its significance in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the
effects of Notch1 expression in ICC tissues and cells. The expression of Notch1
was examined in paraffin-embedded sections of ICC (n=44) by immunohistochemistry.
Notch1 was knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) in cultured ICC cells (RBE and
HCCC-9810). The proliferation, invasiveness and sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation assays,
Transwell assays and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of
several multidrug resistance (MDR)-related genes, MDR1-P-glycoprotein (ABCB‑1),
breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG‑2) and the multidrug resistance protein
isoform 1 (MRP‑1), were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Notch1 was overexpressed in cell
membranes and cytoplasm of ICC compared with the adjacent liver tissue (35/44,
79.5%) and this was more common in cases with tumor size≥5 cm (p=0.021) and
HBs-Ag positive (p=0.018). By silencing Notch1, the proliferation and
invasiveness of ICC cells were inhibited and the inhibition rate of 5-FU was
markedly increased. In addition, IC50 values of 5-FU in RBE cells were decreased 
from 148.74±0.72 to 5.37±0.28 µg/ml and the corresponding values for HCCC-9810
cells were 326.92±0.87 to 42.60±0.35 µg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, Notch1
silencing clearly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells treated by 5-FU
compared with the control. Notch1 knockdown led to diminished expression levels
of ABCB‑1 and MRP‑1. Therefore, Notch may play important roles in the development
of ICC. Silencing Notch1 can inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of ICC
cells and increase their sensitivity to 5-FU in vitro.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors
associated with gastric bleeding in patients treated with radiation therapy for
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 2002 and December 2008, 33 patients with 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were treated with radiation therapy to the
primary site. Twenty-nine (88%) patients were previously treated with
chemotherapy, including gemcitabine and cisplatin in 19 patients. The median dose
of radiation therapy was 50.4 Gy (range, 35-70 Gy). Twenty-seven (82%) patients
received concurrent therapy, with capecitabine in 26 and bevacizumab in 1
patient.
RESULTS: Nine of the 33 patients developed gastric bleeding, with a 1-year
actuarial rate of 36%. Of these 9 patients, 7 presented with bleeding symptoms
and 2 presented with anemia. All 9 patients were documented to have gastritis on 
endoscopy. The absolute and percent volumes of stomach receiving 40 and 50 Gy
were significantly associated with the risk of gastric bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have a significant
risk of developing gastric bleeding after radiation therapy. Hence, the volume of
stomach exposed to radiation therapy should be minimized in patients receiving
radiation therapy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: For patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC),
treatment options are limited and survival is poor. This study summarizes the
long-term outcome of two previously reported clinical trials using hepatic
arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone (with or without
bevacizumab) in advanced ICC.
METHODS: Prospectively collected clinicopathologic and survival data were
retrospectively reviewed. Response was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST). Pre-HAI dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) images were reviewed, and tumor perfusion data correlated with 
outcome.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients were analyzed (floxuridine, 26;
floxuridine/bevacizumab, 18). At a median follow-up of 29.3 months, 41 patients
had died of disease. Partial response by RECIST was observed in 48 %, and 50 %
had stable disease. Three patients underwent resection after response, and 82 %
received additional HAI after removal from the trials. Median survival was
similar in both trials (floxuridine 29.3 months vs. floxuridine/bevacizumab
28.5 months; p = 0.96). Ten (23 %) patients survived ≥3 years, including 5 (11 %)
who survived ≥5 years. Tumor perfusion measured on pre-treatment DCE-MRI [area
under the gadolinium concentration curve at 90 and 180 s (AUC90 and AUC180,
respectively)] was significantly higher in ≥3-year survivors and was the only
factor that distinguished this group from <3-year survivors (mean AUC90 22.6 vs. 
15.9 mM s, p = 0.025, and mean AUC180 48.9 vs. 32.3 mM s, p = 0.003,
respectively). Median hepatic progression-free survival was longer in ≥3-year
survivors (12.9 vs. 9.3 months, respectively; p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: HAI chemotherapy can result in prolonged survival in unresectable
ICC. Pre-HAI DCE-MRI may predict treatment outcome.

Advanced cholangiocarcinoma continues to harbor a difficult prognosis and
therapeutic options have been limited. During the course of a clinical trial of
whole genomic sequencing seeking druggable targets, we examined six patients with
advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Integrated genome-wide and whole transcriptome
sequence analyses were performed on tumors from six patients with advanced,
sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (SIC) to identify potential
therapeutically actionable events. Among the somatic events captured in our
analysis, we uncovered two novel therapeutically relevant genomic contexts that
when acted upon, resulted in preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity.
Genome-wide structural analysis of sequence data revealed recurrent translocation
events involving the FGFR2 locus in three of six assessed patients. These
observations and supporting evidence triggered the use of FGFR inhibitors in
these patients. In one example, preliminary anti-tumor activity of pazopanib (in 
vitro FGFR2 IC50≈350 nM) was noted in a patient with an FGFR2-TACC3 fusion. After
progression on pazopanib, the same patient also had stable disease on ponatinib, 
a pan-FGFR inhibitor (in vitro, FGFR2 IC50≈8 nM). In an independent non-FGFR2
translocation patient, exome and transcriptome analysis revealed an allele
specific somatic nonsense mutation (E384X) in ERRFI1, a direct negative regulator
of EGFR activation. Rapid and robust disease regression was noted in this ERRFI1 
inactivated tumor when treated with erlotinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor. FGFR2
fusions and ERRFI mutations may represent novel targets in sporadic intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma and trials should be characterized in larger cohorts of
patients with these aberrations.

A 48-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of a liver
tumor (diameter, 10 cm), which was detected by abdominal contrast-enhanced
computed tomography. The tumor occupied mainly the left medial segment and
caudate lobe, invaded the left and right hepatic arteries, and obstructed the
left portal vein. The tumor was diagnosed as an unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, and chemotherapy (a combination of gemcitabine and S-1) was
initiated. Because the tumor continued to grow despite the chemotherapy, we
performed transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)as a second-line treatment, which 
successfully reduced tumor size to 7 cm. Thereafter, surgical resection was
performed. Histopathological examination indicated the presence of intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, which formed the main component, combined with hepatocellular
carcinoma. This tumor was diagnosed as a combined hepatocellular and
cholangiocarcinoma. Although adjuvant chemotherapy was not administered because
of prolonged pancytopenia, currently, at 5 years after the operation, the patient
is alive and has not experienced any recurrence.

The influence of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Exendin-4 on development of 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is evaluated in the study. In vitro tests, 
including acute toxicity test, cell colony formation assays, cells proliferation 
and apoptosis, transwell assay, were performed. An ICC in situ tumor animal model
was established. Then, animals were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6):
control, Exendin-4 treatment, oxaliplatin treatment and Exendin-4-oxaliplatin
treatment. Animals in the Exendin-4 treatment and Exendin-4-oxaliplatin treatment
groups received a subcutaneous injection of Exendin-4 (100 μg/kg/day) for 1 week,
and then received oxaliplatin (10 mg/kg/week) by tail vein injection. Animals in 
the control group received PBS. Immunohistochemistry tests were used for PCNA,
Ki67, Caspase 3 expression in tumor tissue. Results show that that, after
incubation of human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, HuCCTI and GLP-1, or HuCCTI
and Exendin-4, colony formation number was sharply decreased. However, GLP-1,
HuCCTI or Exendin-4 did not affect the colony of normal cells. Combination
treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin-4 can significantly inhibit tumor cells'
proliferation and promote apoptosis. The combined effect is stronger than that of
oxaliplatin or Exendin-4. Combination treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin4 can
significantly decrease Ki67 and PCNA proteins' expression in subcutaneous tumors 
of nude mice. The inhibitory effect of Combination treatment with oxaliplatin and
Exendin4 is clearly stronger than that of oxaliplatin. In addition, Combination
treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin4 can significantly increase Caspase3
protein positive expression. In short, these results show that combination
treatment with oxaliplatin and Exendin4 can inhibit tumor cells' proliferation,
and promote apoptosis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prognostic factors and adjuvant therapy of intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) after curative resection were not clear. We aim to
analyse prognostic factors after curative resection and evaluate adjuvant therapy
and survival based on the new staging system.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 283 patients who underwent surgical
exploration for ICC was performed. Staging was performed according to the 7th
edition AJCC staging manual. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to
evaluate independent prognostic factors.
RESULTS: The difference for OS at different TNM stages after R0 resection was
significant (P < 0.001). Despite regional lymph node metastasis, tumour number
and vascular invasion, serum GGT level was also an independent prognostic factor 
for OS of patients after R0 resection. The incidence of biliary and vascular
invasion was significantly higher in high GGT group than in normal GGT group.
Factors predictive of recurrence were multiple tumours and regional lymph node
metastasis. After R0 resection, adjuvant TACE not only did not improve the OS of 
patients at TNM stage I (P = 0.508), but significantly promoted recurrence of
these patients (P = 0.006). Only patients at TNM stage II, III and IV benefited
from adjuvant TACE for longer survival, while the recurrence rates were not
affected.
CONCLUSIONS: The new staging system can predict the survival of ICC patients
after R0 resection. High GGT level may be suggestive of biliary and vascular
invasion and was an independent risk factor for OS after R0 resection. Adjuvant
TACE may be indicated only for patients at advanced stages for better survival.

AIMS: The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated with the outcome
after surgical resection and to compare the efficacy of surgery to transarterial 
chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with advanced intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (IHC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 273 patients with IHC treated in our department between
1997 and 2012 were included in our study. Patients were divided according to
therapy into surgical (n = 130), TACE (n = 32), and systemic chemotherapy/best
supportive care (n = 111) groups. Clinicopathological characteristics and
survival were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in patients after surgical
resection were 60%, 40%, and 23%, respectively. Recurrence occurred in 63 percent
of patients after R0 resection. Median time of recurrence-free survival was 14
months. Univariate analysis revealed nine significant risk factors for overall
survival in the resection group: major surgery, extrahepatic resection, vascular 
and bile duct resection, lymph node invasion, poor tumour differentiation,
positive surgical margin, multiple lesions, tumour diameter, and UICC-Stage.
Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), poor tumour 
differentiation (P = 0.002), and positive resection margins (P = 0.001) were
independent prognostic factors for survival. Median survival as well as overall
survival rates of TACE patients were comparable to those of lymph node positive
patients and patients with tumour positive surgical margins.
CONCLUSIONS: R0 resection in patients with negative lymph node status remains the
best chance for long-term survival in patients with IHC. There is no significant 
survival benefit of surgery in lymph node positive patients or patients with
positive resection margin over TACE.

Locoregional therapy for cholangiocarcinoma.

Kuhlmann JB(1), Blum HE.

jan.kuhlmann@uniklinik-freiburg.de

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cholangiocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection
offers the only curative option and usually requires a major hepatic resection in
addition to resection of the cholangiocarcinoma. Unfortunately, curative
resection is possible in only about 30% of patients due to locally advanced
disease, distant metastases or comorbidity in elderly patients. Even after
resection, the recurrence rate is approximately 60%, resulting in a low 5-year
overall survival (OS). In unresectable cholangiocarcinoma OS with systemic
chemotherapy is less than 1 year. Since most cholangiocarcinoma patients develop 
distant metastases at late stages only, locoregional therapy is an interesting
therapeutic strategy. Here, we review the locoregional concepts of
cholangiocarcinoma therapy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Locoregional therapy studies in patients with intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma employing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) or external as well as internal radiation therapy
yielded promising results in the last couple of years.
SUMMARY: In conclusion, locoregional therapies have been shown to be effective in
patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Local tumour control may prolong
OS and can be achieved by locoregional interventions applied either sequentially 
or in combination with systemic chemotherapies.

The prognosis for patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC)
is extremely poor. Case 1 was a 65- year-old woman who had an ICC of 9 cm in
diameter (mass-forming type) in the right lobe with portal trunk invasion. She
was treated with hepatic arterial infusion
chemotherapy[cisplatin(CDDP)/5-fluorouracil(5-FU)/l-leucovorin(l-LV)] and
radiation therapy (total dose, 50 Gy). After 6 months, abdominal computed
tomography (CT) revealed that the tumor had regressed. She survived for 7 years
without recurrence of the ICC; subsequently, she died of peritoneal cancer. Case 
2 was a 59-year-old woman who had an ICC of 8 cm in diameter (mass-forming type) 
in the left lobe with lymph node metastasis in the hepatoduodenal ligament; the
right hepatic artery was involved by the metastatic lymph nodes. She was treated 
with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(CDDP/5-FU/l-LV) and radiation
therapy(total dose, 30 Gy). After 10 months, abdominal CT revealed that the tumor
had disappeared, but paraaortic and mediastinal lymph node metastases were
detected. She was therefore treated with systemic chemotherapy. Treatment with
systematic chemotherapy enabled her to survive for over 5 years with a good
performance status.

PURPOSE: To evaluate volumetric changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
and contrast material enhancement on contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance
(MR) images in hepatic arterial and portal venous phases for assessing early
response in cholangiocarcinoma treated with transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization (TACE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma,
including 11 men (mean age, 60 years; standard deviation, 16.8) and 18 women
(mean age, 63 years; standard deviation, 11.5) were included in this
retrospective institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study;
informed consent was waived. Sixty-nine TACE procedures were performed during the
observational time (range, one to five TACE sessions). No patients received
another form of therapy after treatment with TACE. MR Imaging was performed
before and 3-4 weeks after TACE, and images were analyzed with a semiautomatic
volumetric software package. Patients were stratified as responders and
nonresponders on the basis of overall survival (OS) as the primary end point.
Differences between responders and nonresponders were analyzed with paired t
tests, and OS was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Significant
differences were analyzed with the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Mean volumetric ADC increased from 1.54×10(-3) mm2/sec to 1.92×10(-3)
mm2/sec (P<.0001), with no significant decrease in mean volumetric enhancement in
hepatic arterial (40.6% vs 37.5%, P=.546) and portal venous (79.0% vs 70.0%,
P=.105) phases. Patients who demonstrated improved survival of 10 months or more 
had a significant increase in mean volumetric ADC and volumetric ADC above the
threshold level of 1.60×10(-3) mm2/sec (P<.002). Patients with 45% or greater
(n=21; log-rank test, P<.02) and 60% or greater (n=12; log-rank test, P<.009) ADC
changes for the whole tumor volume demonstrated better OS compared with patients 
in whom these ADC changes were not achieved.
CONCLUSION: Patients with percentage tumor volume increase in ADC of 45% or
greater and 60% or greater above the threshold level of 1.60×10(-3) mm2/sec had
favorable response to therapy and improved survival.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) 
is currently unsatisfactory. The aims of this study were to identify prognostic
factors after curative ICC resection, and to evaluate the effects of
postoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 114 ICC patients who underwent
curative resection from January 2005 to December 2006. Relationships between
survival and clinicopathological factors were evaluated using univariate and
multivariate analyses. The benefits of adjuvant TACE were investigated
separately.
RESULTS: The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 63%, 26%, and 15%,
respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumour size ≥ 5 cm (hazard
ratio [HR] 1.875, 95% CI 1.139-3.088, P=0.013) and advanced TNM stage (stage III 
or IV) (HR 1.681, 95% CI 1.035-2.732, P=0.036) were independently associated with
poor prognosis. Fifty-seven patients underwent adjuvant TACE. In patients with
poor prognostic factors, TACE improved the survival rate (P<0.001). However, in
patients without poor prognostic factors, TACE did not significantly change the
survival rate (P=0.724).
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative adjuvant TACE can prolong survival in ICC patients
with tumour size ≥ 5 cm or advanced TNM stage.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the mTOR pathway in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma.

Wang Z(1), Zheng T, Wu Q, Wang J, Wu C, Wang J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical
university, Shanghai, China.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of activated mammalian
rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream effectors, phosphorylated p70 ribosomal
protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 
(4EBP1), in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC), in order to strengthen the
rationale for targeted therapy using mTOR inhibitors in patients with ICC. p-mTOR
(Ser 2448), p-4EBP1 (Thr 70) and p-p70S6K (Thr 389) were detected in 77 primary
ICC tumors by immunohistochemistry. High levels of p-mTOR, p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K
expression were defined in 48.1% (37/77), 50.6% (39/77) and 51.9% (40/77) of all 
tumors, respectively. No significant correlation was observed between mTOR
pathway proteins overexpression with clinicopathological characteristics and
patient's prognosis, except that high p-p70S6K expression correlated with the
poorly differentiated subtype, and high expression of p-4EBP1 predicted poor
prognosis in ICC patients and retained an independent prognostic factor in
multivariate analysis. In conclusion, our results showed high prevalence of
activation of mTOR pathway in ICC tumors, suggesting that a high proportion of
ICC patients might benefit from mTOR pathway targeted therapies. In addition,
p-4EBP1 phosphorylation at Thr 70 could be a useful prognostic biomarker for ICC 
patients.

Surgical resection is the gold standard treatment and is considered the only
potential cure for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). However, most of the patients
present at a late stage of disease and positive margins are frequently
encountered. Therefore, adjuvant therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy
and/or radiotherapy are needed to improve the survival time of CCA patients. In
this study, we analyzed retrospectively the clinical features, overall survival
and efficacy with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for 171 intrahepatic CCA
patients. All those with histologically proved intrahepatic CCA diagnosed during 
1998-2002, at Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kean University,
Thailand, were included in this study. All patients were considered to have
resectable tumors with curative intent, 114 patients received postoperative
adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C, of which only 54 patients 
were given the full 6 cycle treatment. Mass forming type CCA was the major type
found in our series. The predictive clinicopathological factors which influenced 
an unfavorable outcome were tumor size >4 cm, multiple masses, mass forming and
periductal gross type, histology with poor differentiation, involvement of
serosa, vasculature or diaphragm, advanced tumor stage and positive surgical
margin. On the other hand, R0 resection, skeletonization of hepatoduodenal
ligaments and complete postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were predictive of a
favorable outcome. Multivariate analysis Cox proportional hazards models revealed
that sex, tumor size, serosa involvement, surgical margin status, skeletonization
and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were independently associated with long
term survival post-surgery. Regardless of the surgical margin status, patients
who received complete postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy had a significant
survival advantage.

Antitumor activity (growth suppression) of vitamin D has been demonstrated using 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell lines, CCA cell-grafted animal models, and human
CCA tissue cultures. The present study aimed to determine the toxicity and
tolerability of intermittent-high dose calcitriol in advanced inoperable
intrahepatic CCA patients and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
combinations of calcitriol and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapeutic drugs. The
patients were divided into 3 groups: the first (n=2) received intermittent-high
dose oral calcitriol 12 μg/day for 3 days, i.e. Monday-Wednesday, per week up to 
3 months. The treatment did not cause any serious adverse events, except
hypercalcemia grade I, once in 72 administrations. The second group (n=3)
received chemotherapeutic drugs (5-fluorouracil, Mitomycin C and Leucovorin) for 
3 cycles, one patient showing a partial response. The third group (n=4) received 
high dose calcitriol in combination with chemotherapeutic-drugs. All 4 patients
encountered serious adverse events and two of them were withdrawn after the first
drug cycle. This pilot study suggests that, although high dose-intermittent
calcitriol appeared to be safe and tolerated well in advanced intrahepatic CCA
patients, co-administration with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapeutic drugs
caused unexpected potentiation of their toxicity. Adjustment of the doses of both
drugs is required to avoid such toxicity and to optimize therapeutic efficacy of 
anticancer drugs when they were combined with high dose-intermittent calcitriol.

PURPOSE: Thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) are 
important enzymes in the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil and possible predictive
markers. We conducted this study to clarify if TS and DPD gene expressions are a 
prognostic indicator for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC).
METHODS: The subjects of this study were 21 patients with IHCC who had undergone 
surgical resection. Intratumoral TS and DPD mRNA expressions were examined using 
the Danenberg tumor profile method and classified into two groups according to
the median value of each. We then compared the clinicopathological variables,
including prognosis, between the high and low expression groups.
RESULTS: Low DPD expression was correlated with macroscopic type, namely,
mass-forming + infiltrative (P = 0.08). Postoperative survival rates in the low
DPD expression group were significantly lower than those in the high DPD
expression group. Multivariate analysis revealed macroscopic type to be an
independent prognostic factor, whereas TS mRNA expression did not correlate with 
any clinicopathological variables, including prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Low DPD mRNA expression was related to macroscopic type and
associated with poor prognosis. DPD mRNA expression in tumor cells is suggested
to be an important regulator of malignant behavior in IHCC.

prognostic significance of AKT1 pathway in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. We
investigated the status of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
10 (PTEN), phosphorylated (p) AKT1 (p-AKT1), p-mammalian target of rapamycin
(p-MTOR), p-p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-RPS6KB2) and p-eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (p-EIF4EBP1) in 101 intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis was performed 
to verify the expression levels of p-AKT1 and p-MTOR. The relationship of protein
expression with clinicopathological data and the correlations of protein
expression levels were explored. The overexpression of p-AKT1, p-MTOR, and PTEN
was associated with a better survival in patients with intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (P=0.0137, 0.0194, and 0.0337, respectively). In a
multivariate analysis, PTEN was an independent prognostic factor, and p-AKT1
showed tendency (P=0.032 and 0.051, respectively). The overexpression of p-MTOR
was correlated with well-to-moderately differentiated tumors (P<0.001) and tumors
without metastasis (P=0.046). Expression levels of the AKT1 signaling pathway
proteins in this study showed positive correlations with each other, except for
PTEN. Aberrant expressions of p-AKT1 and p-MTOR in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma were associated with a favorable prognosis, possibly in a
PTEN-independent manner. Our results indicate that dysregulation of the AKT1
pathway may have an important role in the development of intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, but not necessarily in the progression of the disease.

Second Military Medical University, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.

BACKGROUND: Effects of adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)
for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) radical surgery have never been
evaluated.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 125 ICC patients who had
undergone operations with curative intent in Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital from July 2002 to December 2003. Of these patients, 53 underwent
adjuvant TACE (TACE group) and 72 did not (non-TACE group). Adjuvant TACE was
performed one time 1.5-2.0 months after the operation.
RESULTS: Follow-up was performed at a median of 18 months (range 3-96 months).
There was no significant recurrence-free survival (RFS) difference between the
TACE and non-TACE groups (P = 0.659). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival
(OS) rates were 69.8, 37.7, and 28.3%, respectively, for the TACE group and 54.2,
25.0, and 20.8%, respectively, for the non-TACE group (P = 0.045). Among 54
patients with a recurrence time of ≤ 3 months, the OS rate of the TACE group was 
better than that of the non-TACE group (P < 0.001). For 59 patients with a
recurrence time later than the median RFS, no significant RFS difference was
found between the TACE and non-TACE groups (P = 0.681). These results indicate
that TACE could not delay recurrence but could prolong the OS of patients with
early recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant TACE after radical surgery was associated with better
survival among the ICC patients with early recurrence.

    Oncology. 2011;80(3-4):151-2.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the efficacy and safety of adding systemic
(IV) bevacizumab (Bev) to hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine
(FUDR)/dexamethasone (Dex) in unresectable primary liver cancer.
METHODS: Patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were treated with HAI FUDR/Dex plus IV Bev.
Results were compared to a recent study of HAI without Bev in a similar patient
population.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (18 ICC, 4 HCC) were treated with HAI FUDR/Dex plus 
Bev; 7 (31.8%) had partial response and 15 (68.2%) had stable disease. Median
survival was 31.1 months (CI 14.14-33.59), progression-free survival (PFS) 8.45
months (CI 5.53-11.05), and hepatic PFS 11.3 months (CI 7.93-15.69). In the
previous trial with HAI alone (no Bev), the response was 50%; median survival,
PFS, and hepatic PFS were 29.5, 7.3, and 10.1 months. In the present trial,
bilirubin elevation (>2 mg/dl) was seen in 24% of patients and biliary stents
were placed in 13.6%, versus 5.8 and 0%, respectively, in the HAI trial without
Bev. Due to increased biliary toxicity, the trial was prematurely terminated.
CONCLUSION: Adding Bev to HAI FUDR/Dex appeared to increase biliary toxicity
without clear improvement in outcome (median PFS 8.45 vs. 7.3 months, and median 
survival 31.1 vs. 29.5 months, for HAI + Bev vs. HAI alone groups, respectively).

INTRODUCTION: Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is a rare 
disorder characterized by altered mental status, seizure, hypertension, and
symmetrical white matter edema (leukoencephalopathy) typically in the posterior
cerebral hemispheres on brain imaging. It is often linked to certain medication
use, in particular, chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we present a case of
chemotherapy-related RPLS and review the current literature on this topic.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of RPLS associated with concurrent bevacizumab
(Avastin), gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin use for unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of RPLS associated with bevacizumab, 
gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy. Concurrent use of multiple
agents could significantly increase the risk of RPLS, a potentially fatal
disease. Our case suggests that gradual progression of hypertension and
proteinuria may be early warning signs before the onset of RPLS that should alarm
clinicians.

Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

AIM: To evaluate the clinical outcome and the survival benefits of transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
compared with supportive therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1996 to April 2009, a total of 155 patients
with unresectable ICC met the entry criteria and underwent TACE (72 patients) or 
supportive treatment (83 patients). Their survival was the primary end point.
RESULTS: The baseline patients and tumour characteristics were well-balanced in
the two groups. The median number of sessions per patient was 2.5 (range 1-17
sessions) in the TACE group. After TACE, the incidence of significant (≥ grade 3)
haematological and non-haematological toxicities was 13 and 24%, respectively,
and no patients died within 30 days following TACE. The objective tumour
regression (≥ partial response) was achieved in 23% of the patients in the TACE
group. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the survival period was
significantly longer in the TACE group (median 12.2 months) than in the
symptomatic treatment (median 3.3 months) group (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: TACE is safe and offers greater survival benefits than supportive
treatment for the palliative treatment of unresectable ICC.

Potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of sorafenib against human
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells.

Tsukuba Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is rising in clinical
importance due to the increasing incidence worldwide, poor prognosis, and
suboptimal response to therapies. New effective therapeutic approaches are needed
for improvement of treatment outcome. A recent study showed that sorafenib, a
multikinase inhibitor that acts predominantly through inhibition of Raf kinase
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) receptors, exhibited potent antitumor activity in a preclinical model of
cholangiocarcinoma cells.
METHOD: We tested the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of sorafenib
against human ICC cell lines.
RESULTS: Treatment of ICC cells with sorafenib resulted in inhibition of
proliferation and induction of apoptosis in the cell lines. In the cells treated 
with sorafenib, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and also interleukin-6-induced
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic 
protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) paralleled the reduced phosphorylation of
STAT3. However, sorafenib induced no significant change in the cell cycle
distribution and the expression levels of cyclin D1 and p27(Kip1) in the cells.
For the in vivo antitumor activity, oral administration of sorafenib
significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors established in
immunodeficient mice at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg. Moreover, administration 
of sorafenib (30 mg/kg) to animals with peritoneally disseminated ICC resulted in
significantly prolonged survival compared with that of untreated animals (76 vs. 
43 days in treated and vehicle-treated mice, respectively).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that sorafenib is a potent agent that may
provide a new therapeutic option for human ICC.

BACKGROUND: Image-guided transcatheter hepatic chemoembolization (TACE) is
accepted worldwide as an effective treatment for patients with unresectable
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and for adequate preservation of liver function.
Although considered relatively safe, TACE has been associated with several
complications. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the
complications associated with TACE therapy and to correlate it with certain risk 
factors, either well-known or not yet evaluated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 330 chemoembolization procedures performed in
170 patients (117 males and 53 females) over a period of 64 months were
retrospectively analysed. Among the patients, 123 had hepatocellular carcinoma,
10 had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 37 had hepatic metastases. The
variables considered were: tumour histotype, bilioenteric anastomosis, previous
or combined treatment with radiofrequency thermal ablation, antibiotic
prophylaxis, chemotherapeutic agents, use of new drug-eluting microspheres,
comorbidities such as diabetes, patient age and the presence of vascular
anatomical variations.
RESULTS: A total of 30 complications occurred in 27 procedures. The total
complication rate per procedure was 9.1% and approximately 75% of patients had
postembolization syndrome. The difference in the prevalence of complications was 
statistically significant in the group of diabetic patients (13.3%) compared to
the remaining patients (6.3%) (p = 0.002) and in patients with biliary stents
(25%) compared to those without stents (7.75%) (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: These data show that diabetes mellitus and the presence of
bilioenteric anastomosis are risk factors for developing complications after
TACE. The use of new drug-eluting microspheres did not increase the risk of
complications.

Acquisition of chemoresistance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells by
activation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2.

Author information: 
(1)Therapeutic Antibody Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience
and Biotechnology, Daejeon 305-806, Republic of Korea.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignant tumor and is
refractory to conventional chemotherapy. The aim of this study is therefore to
elucidate the mechanism of chemoresistance in ICC which is not fully understood. 
We generated cisplatin resistant ICC cells via long term exposure to cisplatin
and found that these cells are also resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and
gemcitabine. The chemoresistant cells showed enhanced Bcl-2 expression and
reduced Bax expression compared to parental ICC cells. In addition, the resistant
cells showed enhanced activation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2. Inhibition of AKT activation by phosphoinocitide 3-kinase (PI3K)
inhibitor LY294002 resulted in reduced Bcl-2 expression and enhanced Bax
expression and thus induced apoptosis in the resistant cells, whereas inhibition 
of ERK1/2 activation by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126
did not induce apoptosis without affecting the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax but
decreased cell growth. Moreover, the inhibition of AKT or ERK1/2 sensitized the
resistant cells to cisplatin and therefore resulted in greatly enhanced
cisplatin-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in the cells. The results
indicate that AKT and ERK1/2 signaling mediate chemoresistance in the cells and
could be important therapeutic targets for overcoming chemoresistance in ICC.

AIMS:   Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidylate synthase (TS) are
key enzymes in the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil and have been implicated as
possible prognostic markers for cancer patients. However, the clinical roles of
DPD and TS in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) have not been investigated. 
The aim of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological role of DPD and TS
expressions in IHCC.
METHODS:   Twenty-nine patients who had undergone hepatic resection for IHCC were
enrolled in this study. Expressions of DPD and TS in the resected IHCC specimens 
were examined using anti-DPD or anti-TS antibody. The patients were divided into 
positive and negative groups according to DPD/TS expressions: DPD-positive group 
(n = 18) and DPD-negative group (n = 11)/TS-positive group (n = 14) and
TS-negative group (n = 15). Clinicopathological factors were compared between the
two groups.
RESULTS:   The overall survival rate was significantly lower in the DPD-negative 
group than in the DPD-positive group (1-year 36.4% vs. 77.4%, 3-year 18.2% vs.
43.0%; P < 0.05). The disease-free survival rate in the DPD-negative group tended
to be lower than that in the DPD-positive group. The overall survival rate or
disease-free survival rate did not appear to be associated with the TS-expression
status. The Ki-67 labeling index in the DPD-negative group was significantly
higher than that in the DPD-positive group (16.9 ± 3.2% vs.13.2 ± 3.3%;
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS:   The negative DPD expression was significantly associated with the 
enhanced tumor cell proliferation and poorer prognosis in patients with IHCC. DPD
expression is a potential prognostic indicator for IHCC.

Effective treatment of advanced cholangiocarcinoma by hepatic arterial infusion
chemotherapy combination with sorafenib: one case report from China.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cholangiocarcinoma, especially intrahepatic type, is difficult
to be found early and diagnosed at early stages. Although it was reported as rare
to happen, it is a well-known devastating malignancy with little treatment
effects. As a result, most of the patients suffer from poor prognosis. On the
other hand, the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arises worldwide.
Radical surgical resection was regarded as the most effective treatment, in spite
of recurrence. Unfortunately, only 30 percent of patients qualify for this at the
time of diagnosis. Hence, for advanced cholangiocarcinoma, chemotherapy is the
only modality left to be chosen. Recently LaRocca and Kudoh reported about
effective chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma. Even so, because of no randomized 
study, no standard chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma has been accepted, and
most of the projects were based on 5-Fu. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor,
which can competitively inhibit RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, human vascular endothelial
growth factor receptors (VEGFR2, VEGFR3) platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
beta (PDGFR), Flt3, and C-kit receptors, has been successfully applied for solid 
tumors such as renal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib used alone or
in combinations, can induce growth-inhibition and apoptosis in vitro experiments.
Application of sorafenib alone for cholangiocarcinoma has also been published.
The role of combination with other chemotherapy drugs in advanced
cholangiocarcinoma still needs to be defined.
METHODOLOGY: A patient admitted for exploratory operation was demonstrated to be 
suffering from unresectable, biopsy-proven intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A
pump was placed inside hepatic artery, for the purpose of infusion chemotherapy. 
Program of chemotherapy was scheduled and hepatic arterial infusion of 5-Fu/LV
+oxaliplatin +hydroxycamptothecine was performed. Three months later, no effect
was discovered, so sorafenib was suggested to combine with infusion chemotherapy.
For the first time we applied sorafenib combination to hepatic arterial infusion 
chemotherapy
RESULT: After lower dosage of sorafenib was used as a combination with hepatic
arterial infusion chemotherapy, size of hepatic lesions and level CA19-9 of
peripheral blood count were decreased, without any damage to the hepatic
function, except for temporary skin hyperkeratosis as well as vomit. Efficacy of 
treatment was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scan.
CONCLUSION: So far as in our patient, the application of sorafenib combination
with other agents through hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy may be an
effective way for cholangiocarcinoma, but the definite mechanism has to be
confirmed by methods of molecular biology.

Carcinoma of the biliary tree are rare tumors of the gastrointestinal tract with 
worldwide rising incidence for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma during the last
years. Although complete surgical resection is the only curative approach, this
can be accomplished in a minority of patients, since most of them present with
advanced disease. In addition, those patients who have undergone complete
surgical resection experience a high tumor recurrence rate. Non-resectable
biliary tract cancer is associated with a poor prognosis due to wide resistance
to chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy. It is therefore essential to search 
for new therapeutical approaches. After several years of preclinical research,
the first clinical study data are now available for this tumor entity. Inhibitors
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, such as erlotinib,
cetuximab, and lapatinib were recently investigated. Furthermore, bortezomib, an 
inhibitor of the proteasome, imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of c-kit-R,
bevacizumab, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a multiple kinase inhibitor that blocks not only
receptor tyrosine kinases but also serine/threonine kinases along the
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, were studied, as well. Although early evidence of
antitumor activity was seen, the results are still preliminary and require
further investigations.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare life-threatening disease, whose
only treatment with potential for cure is surgical resection. However, only 27%
of patients at most are suitable for surgery when first diagnosed. For patients
with unresectable disease, therapeutic options are chemotherapy or
chemoradiation. We evaluated the feasibility and safety of oxaliplatin-eluting
microspheres transarterial chemoembolization (OEM-TACE) associated with
chemotherapy (ChT) in patients affected by unresectable ICC. Between December
2005 and May 2008 we treated nine patients (six female and three male) with
unresectable ICC. All patients had undergone OEM-TACE associated with
chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and gemcitabine. A retrospective comparison was
carried out with a historical group of 11 patients treated with ChT only,
estimating the prevalence of adverse effects and the median survival of the two
groups. A total of 30 TACEs were performed during the observational time (ranging
from one to seven procedures per patient). OEM-TACEs were followed by few adverse
effects (AEs), without G4 AEs, according to CTACAE 3.0. According to RECIST
criteria, 44% (4/9) of patients achieved partial responses and 56% (5/9)
stabilization of disease. Overall survival analysis in the two groups showed a
significantly increased survival in patients treated with ChT and OEM-TACE, with 
respect to those treated with ChT (30 vs. 12.7 months; p=0.004). In conclusion,
in our experience OEM-TACE associated with ChT in the treatment of advanced
unresectable ICC is a safe and feasible treatment causing no major adverse
events. Although RECIST criteria can underestimate the rate of responses in
patients treated with locoregional therapies, we achieved very encouraging
results. A randomized multicentric trial is warranted to assess the actual
superiority of OEM-TACE associated with ChT compared to conventional
chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: While conventional transhepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is 
accepted worldwide as an effective treatment for patients with unresectable
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its use in other hepatic tumors is not supported 
by randomized studies. Preliminary results have shown that new drug-eluting
microspheres (DEM) seem to optimize TACE procedures. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the capability of HepaSphere to load oxaliplatin and their
pharmacokinetic outcome. The feasibility and safety of treatment with
oxaliplatin-eluting microspheres (OEM-TACE) was also evaluated in patients with
unresectable liver metastasis of colorectal cancer and unresectable intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)
was used to quantify the oxaliplatin bound to microspheres and the oxaliplatin in
liver biopsies. Fifteen patients (8 with colorectal carcinoma liver metastases, 7
with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) were treated with 27 sessions of OEM-TACE.
RESULTS: The data suggested that the microspheres can bind oxaliplatin entirely. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly different between the OEM-TACE 
patients and a control group of patients treated with oxaliplatin chemotherapy.
The mean oxaliplatin concentration within the tumor was twenty-times higher than 
the extratumoral liver concentration in the OEM-TACE patients. According to
response evaluating criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), stable disease was
observed in 8 out of the 15 patients (53.3%), a partial response in 2 (13.3%) and
intrahepatic or extrahepatic tumor progression in 5 out of the 15 patients
(33.3%). No major adverse event (AE G3/4) occurred.
CONCLUSION: TACE with oxaliplatin-loaded microspheres is a safe and feasible
treatment without major adverse events and with a favorable pharmacokinetic
profile.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma account for 13% of annual cancer-related deaths
worldwide and for 3% in the USA. Patient with unresectable disease can benefit
from palliative therapies such as systemic chemotherapy. However, the only
curative treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is complete surgical
resection with histologically negative resection margins.

BACKGROUND: The role of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or
transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion (TACI) for unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has recently been questioned. The aim of the study was
to evaluate the clinical efficacy of TACE or TACI in patients with unresectable
ICC and to identify prognostic factors associated with clinical success.
METHODS: From 1997 to 2007, 49 patients with unresectable ICC were treated with
TACE (n = 124) or transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion (TACI) (n = 96). Tumor
response was evaluated based on computed tomography scans obtained 1 month to 3
months after TACE or TACI. Factors associated with clinical success were
evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Factors associated
with the survival period were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression
analysis.
RESULTS: After treatment, 27 (55%) of the patients showed radiographic response. 
Multivariate analysis confirmed that tumor vascularity (odds ratio [OR], 31.2; P 
= .002) was the only independent factor associated with radiographic response.
The median and mean survival periods in our study patients were 12 and 24 months.
Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that tumor size (OR, 2.64; P = .048),
tumor vascularity (OR, 13.5; P < .001), and the Child-Pugh class (OR, 3.65; P =
.014) were the independent factors associated with the length of the survival
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy is well tolerated and may be
effective to prolong survival of patients with unresectable ICC. Tumor
vascularity is significantly associated with radiographic response. Large tumor
size, tumor hypovascularity, and Child-Pugh class B were poor prognostic factors 
for determining the patient survival period.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a therapeutically challenging malignancy. This report
describes a case where the patient received multimodal therapy, including
surgery, adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, and combination chemotherapy and
successfully achieved long-term survival. Specifically, the patient achieved an
extended complete response after combination chemotherapy with TS-1 (an orally
administered drug that is a combination of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,
4-dihydroxypyridine [CDHP], and oteracil potassium [Oxo]) and cisplatin for
recurrence. This result suggests that chemoradiation or combination chemotherapy 
regimens using oral 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) analogues might therefore be helpful in
patients with this malignancy. However, further clinical trials are required.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TACE with
microspheres preloaded with doxorubicin in unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (UCH). Twenty patients with UCH were observed; 9 refused,
preferring other palliative care or chemotherapy, and 11 agreed to be treated
with one or more cycles of DC beads loaded with doxorubicin (100-150 mg) in a
TACE procedure between February 2006 and September 2007. A total of 29 individual
TACE procedures were performed. Follow-up imaging was performed on all patients
before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after each TACE procedure to evaluate the 
response and need for further treatment. Each patient received i.v hydration,
antibiotics, and medications against nausea and pain before TACE. Survival rate
was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curve. A response rate of 100%
followed RECIST criteria was observed. Eight of eleven patients are alive, with a
median survival of 13 months. TACE was well tolerated by all patients. One
patient developed hepatic abscess requiring antibiotic therapy. No evidence of
marrow toxicity has been reported. Only one of nine patients treated with
chemotherapy or palliative care is alive (with a median survival of 7 months in
this group of patients). In conclusion, we suggest that doxorubicin-eluting beads
TACE is a feasible and effective treatment in patients with UCH. Survival seems
to be clearly prolonged in the treated group with respect to the palliative
group. We consider that doxorubicin-eluting beads TACE of 100-150 mg may be an
appropriate palliative therapy for these patients. Further studies are warranted 
to confirm these interesting preliminary data.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the biological characteristics and
sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy of intrahepatic and extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro.
METHODS: The intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were
established, and cells with steady passage were chosen to study the biological
characteristics including morphology, growth dynamics, chromosome, and levels of 
cancer antigen (CA) 125, CA19-9, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and carcino-embryonic
antigen (CEA). Meanwhile, MTT assay was used to determine the sensitivity of both
kinds of cells to 6 chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, paclitaxel,
harringtonine, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and aclacimomycin, and the inhibitory
rate of cells under the irradiation of 10 Gy ray was also measured.
RESULTS: The intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were mostly fusiform in shape,
and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were mostly round or polygon in shape. 
Their doubling time was 26. 3 hours and 23. 1 hours, respectively. Their average 
number of chromosomes was 59 (range, 38-84) and 67 (range, 49-103), respectively.
The chromosome karyotypes of most intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were
hyperdiploid and hypotriploid, while hypertriploid was predominant in
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells. The level of CA 125 in supernatant of
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells increased obviously, while levels of other 
determined tumor markers in both kinds of cells were all within normal range. The
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were low sensitive to cisplatin and
paclitaxel, but not sensitive to the other 4 chemotherapeutic drugs. The
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells were high sensitive to cisplatin, but not
sensitive to the other 5 drugs. Both kinds of cells had poor sensitivity to
radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells show
differences in shape, doubling time, chromosome karyotype, tumor marker level,
and chemosensitivity, whereas they both have poor radiosensitivity. Though they
are similar in histopathology, they have different growth characteristics and
have discrepancy in treatment and prognosis.

This report describes a 74-year-old male with unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However surgical procedure is the only curative
treatment, it often seems to be ineffective because of the aggressive behaviour
of the disease. The role of systemic chemotherapy in the ICC is undefined with a 
median survival between 6.43 to 12.17 months obtained by using the combination
chemotherapy of gemcitabine with cisplatin. In the present case, we performed a
targeted treatment using drug eluting beads (DEB) with irinotecan (IRI)
administered as transarterial-chemoembolization (TACE). After one session, the
tumour vascularity decreased significantly at the one month evaluation on
computed tomography (CT) scan of the liver. This case report suggested that
minimally invasive transcatheter DEB embolization could be a promising, safe and 
effective treatment for selective patients with unresectable ICC.

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the safety and efficacy of
chemoembolization (TACE) as palliative treatment for patients with unresectable
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and to compare the results with those in
the literature. Fifteen patients with histology-proven CCA (5 men, 10 women) had 
received palliative treatment with TACE over a 6-year period. The treatment
protocol comprised repeated TACE at a minimum of 8-week intervals. TACE was
performed with a mixture of 10 ml Lipiodol and 10 mg mitomycin C injected into
the tumor-supplying vessels. Follow-up investigations after 8-10 weeks comprised 
contrast-enhanced multislice spiral CT and laboratory control. Statistical
evaluation included survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method. During the
investigation period 58 TACEs (3.9 +/- 3.8; 1-15) were performed in 15 patients. 
Mean tumor size was 10.8 +/- 4.6 cm (range, 2.0-18.0 cm). Unifocal tumor disease 
was diagnosed in eight patients, and multifocal disease in seven. Mean survival
was 21.1 months (95% CI, 9.4-32.5 months). At the end of the investigation period
3 patients are still alive, and 12 patients have died. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year
survival rate was 51.3%, 27.5%, and 27.5% respectively. According to RECIST
criteria interim best response to therapy was stable disease in 9 of 15 patients,
a partial response in 1 of 15 patients, and tumor progression in 4 of 15
patients. No deaths and no acute liver failure occurred under TACE therapy. Major
complications were observed in two patients, comprising anaphylactic shock owing 
to contrast medium administration in one and gastric ulceration due to lipiodol
displacement in the second patient. These results demonstrate that TACE is a safe
procedure with a moderate number of complications for patients suffering from
inoperable CCA. According to recently published data on i.v. chemotherapy we
suggest that TACE might be able to prolong survival in selected patients who
would succumb under other palliative treatment modalities.

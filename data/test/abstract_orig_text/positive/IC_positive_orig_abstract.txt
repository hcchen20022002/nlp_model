BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine with capecitabine (gem-cap) is an established regimen for
advanced biliary cancer (ABC) supported by our previously reported phase II
trial. Here, we provide our updated experience.
METHODS: Single institution, retrospective study from 2005 to 2015 of ABC treated
with gem-cap.
RESULTS: A total of 372 patients with ABC were identified, of whom 227 (61.0%)
were treated with chemotherapy. 153 patients (67.4%) received gem-cap, of which
129 (56.8%) received it in the first line. Thirty two point six percent (42/129) 
were locally advanced, 67.4% (87/129) had metastatic disease, and 18.6% (24/129) 
received it as adjuvant therapy. Disease sites included 48.8% [63] intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), 24.0% [31] extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) and 
27.1% [35] gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Median follow-up was 49.7 months (mo).
The median PFS and OS were 8.0 mo [95% confidence intervals (CI): 6.0-9.3] and
13.0 mo (95% CI: 10.7-17.4), respectively. Overall, 53.5% (69/129) experienced a 
grade 3/4 toxicity. The most common (35.7%) was a hematologic toxicity
(neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) followed by infection (25.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Gem-cap provides similar survival outcomes to gemcitabine/cisplatin 
based on historical comparison to the ABC-2 trial (median PFS =8.0 mo and OS
=11.7 mo). Gem-cap may offer the advantage of fewer adverse events compared to
the levels reported in ABC-2 (grade 3/4 events 70.7%).

Biliary tract cancers (BTC), including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer,
are poor-prognosis and low-incidence cancers, although the incidence of
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is rising. A minority of patients present with
resectable disease but relapse rates are high; benefit from adjuvant capecitabine
chemotherapy has been demonstrated. Cisplatin/gemcitabine combination
chemotherapy has emerged as the reference first-line treatment regimen; there is 
no standard second-line therapy. Selected patients may be suitable for
liver-directed therapy (e.g., radioembolization or external beam radiation),
pending confirmation of benefit in randomized studies. Initial trials targeting
the epithelial growth factor receptor and angiogenesis pathways have failed to
deliver new treatments. Emerging data from next-generation sequencing analyses
have identified actionable mutations (e.g., FGFR fusion rearrangements and IDH1
and IDH2 mutations), with several targeted drugs entering clinical development
with encouraging results. The role of systemic therapies, including targeted
therapies and immunotherapy for BTC, is rapidly evolving and is the subject of
this review.Significance: The authors address genetic drivers and molecular
biology from a translational perspective, in an intent to offer a clear view of
the recent past, present, and future of BTC. The review describes a
state-of-the-art update of the current status and future directions of research
and therapy in advanced BTC. Cancer Discov; 7(9); 943-62. ©2017 AACR.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a lethal malignancy
without effective treatment options. MLN0128, a second generation pan-mTOR
inhibitor, shows efficacy for multiple tumor types. We evaluated the therapeutic 
potential of MLN0128 vs. gemcitabine/oxaliplatin in a novel ICC mouse model.
METHODS: We established a novel ICC mouse model via hydrodynamic transfection of 
activated forms of AKT (myr-AKT) and Yap (YapS127A) protooncogenes (that will be 
referred to as AKT/YapS127A). Genetic approaches were applied to study the
requirement of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in mediating AKT/YapS127A driven tumorigenesis. 
Gemcitabine/oxaliplatin and MLN0128 were administered in AKT/YapS127A
tumor-bearing mice to study their anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. Multiple human ICC
cell lines were used for in vitro experiments. Hematoxylin and eosin staining,
immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were applied for the characterization and
mechanistic study.
RESULTS: Co-expression of myr-AKT and YapS127A promoted ICC development in mice. 
Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes were required for AKT/YapS127A ICC development. 
Gemcitabine/oxaliplatin had limited efficacy in treating late stage AKT/YapS127A 
ICC. In contrast, partial tumor regression was achieved when MLN0128 was applied 
in the late stage of AKT/YapS127A cholangiocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, when
MLN0128 was administered in the early stage of AKT/YapS127A carcinogenesis, it
led to disease stabilization. Mechanistically, MLN0128 efficiently inhibited
AKT/mTOR signaling both in vivo and in vitro, inducing strong ICC cell apoptosis 
and only marginally affecting proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that mTOR kinase inhibitors may be beneficial
for the treatment of ICC, even in tumors that are resistant to standard of care
chemotherapeutics, such as gemcitabine/oxaliplatin-based regimens, especially in 
the subset of tumors exhibiting activated AKT/mTOR cascade. Lay summary: We
established a novel mouse model of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Using
this new preclinical model, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of mTOR
inhibitor MLN0128 vs. gemcitabine/oxaliplatin (the standard chemotherapy for ICC 
treatment). Our study shows the anti-neoplastic potential of MLN0128, suggesting 
that it may be superior to gemcitabine/oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for the
treatment of ICC, especially in the tumors exhibiting activated AKT/mTOR cascade.

BACKGROUND: The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is unclear. The aim of the current study was to
investigate the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival among patients
undergoing resection of ICC using a multi-institutional database.
METHODS: 1154 ICC patients undergoing curative-intent hepatectomy between 1990
and 2015 were identified from 14 institutions. Cox proportional hazard modeling
was used to determine the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival
(OS).
RESULTS: Following resection, 347 (30%) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, 
most commonly a gemcitabine-based regimen (n = 184, 52%). Patients with T2/T3/T4 
disease were more likely to receive adjuvant therapy compared with patients with 
T1a/T1b disease (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1.89-3.23; P < 0.001). Among patients who did and 
did not receive adjuvant therapy, patients with T2/T3/T4 tumors had a 5-year OS
of 37% (95%CI 28.9-44.4) versus 30% (95%CI 23.8-35.6), respectively (p = 0.006). 
Similarly patients with N1 disease who received adjuvant chemotherapy tended to
have improved 5-year OS (18.3%, 95%CI 9.0-30.1 vs. no adjuvant therapy 12%, 95%CI
3.9-24.4; P = 0.050).
CONCLUSIONS: While adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence the prognosis of all
ICC patients following surgical resection, it was associated with a potential
survival benefit in subgroups of patients at increased risk for recurrence, such 
as those with advanced tumors.

X-linked ribosomal protein S4 (RPS4X) has previously been reported to be
associated with cisplatin resistance and clinical outcome in bladder and ovarian 
cancer. However, the value of RPS4X as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has not yet been investigated. The present 
study evaluated the expression pattern, and diagnostic and prognostic value of
RPS4X in patients with ICC. Retrospective analysis was performed for a total of
201 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 8 patients with
inflammation of the bile duct. Immunohistochemistry was performed using tissue
microarrays to characterize the expression profile of RPS4X. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves, the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression
analysis were applied to evaluate the potential diagnostic and prognostic value
of RPS4X in ICC. RPS4X was significantly upregulated in ICC tissues compared with
the inflamed bile duct tissues. When differentiating ICC from normal controls,
ROC analysis of RPS4X gave an area under the curve value of 0.9030 (sensitivity, 
82.59%; specificity, 100%). RPS4X expression was significantly positively
correlated with serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Survival analysis demonstrated
that RPS4X expression levels were an independent prognostic factor for overall
survival. Therefore, RPS4X expression levels may serve as a novel diagnostic and 
prognostic marker in ICC.

Background: c-MET is a proto-oncogene that encodes the tyrosine kinase receptor
for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Activation of HGF-c-MET signaling involves
cell invasiveness and evokes metastasis through direct involvement of tumor
angiogenesis. However, the value of c-MET overexpression is still unknown in
metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). Methods: We analyzed the incidence and
clinicopathologic characteristics of c-MET overexpression in advanced BTC.
Moreover, we investigated the value of c-MET overexpression in predicting
response to gemicitabine plus cisplatin (GC), a first line standard regimen, and 
as a prognostic marker in metastatic BTC. Results: The BTC subtype distribution
(N=44) was as follows: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC, n=7), extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC, n=25) and gallbladder cancer (GBC, n=12). Liver (52.3%)
was the predominant metastatic site, followed by lymph nodes (36.4%) and bone
(15.9%). Among the 44 patients analyzed for c-MET expression, 15 (34.1%)
exhibited c-MET overexpression in tumor tissues. There was no significant
difference in the prevalence of c-MET overexpression among primary sites in EHCC 
(7/25, 28.0%), IHCC (3/7, 42.9%), and GBC (5/12, 41.7%). There was also no
significant correlation between specific clinicopathologic variables and c-MET
expression. Comparing the tumor-response to GC according to c-MET expression
(overexpression vs. non-overexpression), there was no significant difference in
either RR or DCR (p=0.394 and p >0.999, respectively). The median PFS for all 44 
patients was 9.00 months (95% CI, 7.5-10.5 months) and there was no significant
difference for PFS between patients with c-MET overexpression and those without
(p=0.917). The median OS was 14.4 months (95% CI, 11.9-16.9 months). There was no
significant difference in OS between patients with c-MET overexpression compared 
to those without (13.7 vs. 14.4 months, respectively; p=0.708). Conclusions:
c-MET overexpression was detected in 34.1% of advanced BTC patients irrespective 
of tumor location. c-MET overexpression did not predict response to GC or
survival. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the value of c-MET
overexpression as a novel biomarker in these patients.

BACKGROUND: CUL4A has been known for its oncogenic properties in various human
cancers. However, its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) has not been
explored.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 105 iCCA cases from a single medical
institution. Tissue microarrays were used for immunohistochemical analysis of
CUL4A expression. CUL4A expression vectors were introduced in cell lines. Cell
migration and invasion assays were used to compare the mobility potential of iCCA
cells under basal conditions and after manipulation. Then we evaluated the
effects of CUL4A on the cell growth by proliferation assay, and further checked
the susceptibility to cisplatin in iCCA cells with or without CUL4A
overexpression.
RESULTS: CUL4A overexpression was detected in 34 cases (32.4%). Patients with
CUL4A-overexpressing tumors exhibited shortened disease-free survival (mean, 27.7
versus 90.4 months; P = 0.011). In the multivariate analysis model, CUL4A
overexpression was shown to be an independent unfavorable predictor for
disease-free survival (P = 0.045). Moreover, stably transfected
CUL4A-overexpressing iCCA cell lines displayed an increased mobility potential
and enhanced cell growth without impact on susceptibility to cisplatin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that overexpression of CUL4A plays an oncogenic
role in iCCA and adversely affects disease-free survival. Thus, it may prove to
be a powerful prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target.

Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is caused by the oversecretion of
parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) from malignant tumors. Although any
tumor may cause HHM, that induced by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or
gastric cancer (GC) is rare. We report here a 74-year-old male who displayed HHM 
with both ICC and GC and showed an elevated serum PTHrP level. Treatment of the
hypercalcemia with saline, furosemide, elcatonin, and zoledronic acid corrected
his serum calcium level and improved symptoms. Because treatment of ICC should
precede that of GC, we chose chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and gemcitabine
(GEM). Chemotherapy reduced the size of the ICC and decreased the serum PTHrP
level. One year after diagnosis, the patient was alive in the face of a poor
prognosis for an ICC that produced PTHrP. Immunohistochemical staining for PTHrP 
was positive for the ICC and negative for the GC, leading us to believe that the 
cause of the HHM was a PTHrP-secreting ICC. In conclusion, immunohistochemical
staining for PTHrP may be useful in discovering the cause of HHM in the case of
two cancers accompanied by an elevated serum PHTrP level. Chemotherapy with CDDP 
and GEM may be the most appropriate treatment for a PTHrP-secreting ICC.

Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a heterogeneous group of cancers, which is composed
of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(ECCA), gallbladder cancers and ampullary carcinomas. While all anatomic
subgroups are treated uniformly, our understanding about the pathogenesis has
allowed us to reason that each group represents a clinically and genetically
diverse disease. The majority of patients present with locally advanced or
metastatic disease, where the standard treatment is combination systemic
cytotoxic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. While most receive a
clinical benefit from chemotherapy, patients eventually progress where no
standardized therapies are available in the refractory setting. With the use of
next generation sequencing, we have come to understand that ICCA is a diverse
genomic disease with many actionable alterations that may serve as potential
therapeutic targets. Further studies investigating the role of novel targeted
agents (as a single agent or with combination chemotherapy) will hopefully
provide additional treatment options for this highly lethal disease.

Biliary tract cancers (BTC)/Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive biliary
tract epithelial malignancy from varying locations within the biliary tree with
cholangiocyte depreciation., including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA)
(iCCA), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC).
The disease is largely heterogeneous in etiology, epidemiology, and molecular
profile. There are limited treatment options and low survival rates for those
patients with advanced or metastatic disease. Systemic treatment is confined to
cytotoxic chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Lack of
a stereotype genetic signature makes difficult in identification of potential
actionable target directly, which may also explain lack of obvious clinic benefit
with target oriented agents from current studies. It is crucial to understand of 
BTC carcinogenesis, tumor-stroma interactions, and key molecular pathways, and
herald to establish targeted, individualized therapies for the heterogeneous
disease, and eventually to improve the survival and overall outcome of patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to down-stage
unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) to resectable lesions, as
well as the factors associated with achieving such down-staging.
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 120 patients diagnosed with stage I-IVA IHCC 
between 2001 and 2012. Of these patients, 56 underwent surgery and 64 received
CRT as their initial treatment. The rate of curative resections for patients who 
received CRT was assessed, and the locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS) and
overall survival (OS) rates of these patients were compared to those of patients 
who underwent CRT alone.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 36 months. A partial response after CRT was
observed in 25% of patients, whereas a biologic response (a >70% decrease of
CA19-9) was observed in 35%. Eight patients (12.5%) received curative resection
after CRT and showed significantly improved LRFFS and OS compared to those
treated with CRT alone (3-year LRFFS: 50 vs. 15.7%, respectively, p = 0.03;
3‑year OS: 50 vs. 11.2%, respectively, p = 0.012); these rates were comparable to
those of patients who received initial surgery. Factors associated with curative 
surgery after CRT were gemcitabine administration, higher radiotherapy dose
(biological effective dose ≥55 Gy with α/β = 10), and a >70% reduction of CA19-9.
CONCLUSION: Upfront CRT could produce favorable outcomes by converting
unresectable lesions to resectable tumors in selected patients. Higher
radiotherapy doses and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy yielded a significant
reduction of CA19-9 after CRT; patients with these characteristics had a greater 
chance of curative resection and improved OS.

Cholangiocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and is refractory to conventional
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Improving survival of patients with advanced 
cholangiocarcinoma urgently requires the development of new effective targeted
therapies in combination with chemotherapy. We previously developed a human
monoclonal antibody (mAb) Ab417 that binds to both the human and mouse L1 cell
adhesion molecule (L1CAM) with high affinities. In the present study, we observed
that Ab417 exhibited tumor targeting ability in biodistribution studies and
dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(Choi-CK) xenograft mouse model. Regarding the mechanism of action, Ab417 was
internalized into the tumor cells and thereby down-regulated membrane L1CAM, and 
inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Gemcitabine 
inhibited the tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner in the Choi-CK xenograft
model. However, cisplatin inhibited the tumor growth moderately and not in a
dose-dependent way, suggesting that the tumors may have developed resistance to
apoptosis induced by cisplatin. Combined treatment with Ab417 and gemcitabine or 
cisplatin exerted enhanced tumor growth inhibition compared to treatment with
antibody or drug alone. The results suggest that Ab417 in combination with
chemotherapy may have potential as a new therapeutic regimen for
cholangiocarcinoma. Our study is the first to show an enhanced therapeutic effect
of a therapeutic antibody targeting L1CAM in combination with chemotherapy in
cholangiocarcinoma models.

An 82-year-old man with upper abdominal pain was referred to our hospital because
of an elevated serum CEA level and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts on
ultrasonography.Computed tomography revealed a hypovascular mass measuring 5.0 cm
in size in the lateral section, dilatation of the peripheral intrahepatic bile
ducts, and swollen lymph nodes around the lesser curvature of the stomach, the
common hepatic artery, and the paraaorta.He was diagnosed with unresectable
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and he received chemotherapy with biweekly
gemcitabine plus cisplatin.After 33 courses of the chemotherapy, computed
tomography revealed that the tumor size decreased over 63%, and all swollen lymph
nodes had almost resolved.He underwent a left hemihepatectomy 1 year 6 months
after the start of the chemotherapy.He remains alive and well with no evidence of
recurrence, 11 months after resection.

Biliary tract cancers represent an uncommon, heterogenous malignant group of
tumors that include gallbladder cancers (GBC) and cholangiocarcinomas that are
frequently detected in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. The randomized
phase III ABC-02 trial established the combination regimen of cisplatin plus
gemcitabine as standard of care therapy. Nevertheless, despite prior and
subsequent attempts utilizing a variety of treatment strategies clinical outcomes
for these cancers remains disappointing, necessitating the innate call for
improvements in treatment approaches. In this article, we provide an overview of 
prior first line studies of single, doublet and triplet systemic chemotherapy
regimens as well as attempts to incorporate agents that target the EGFR and VEGF 
pathways in combination with a cytotoxic backbone and the current role of
chemotherapy in the second line setting. Additionally, molecular profiling has
the capability to identify genetic alterations to help guide rational treatment
approaches; we highlight the molecular diverse profile within biliary cancer and 
the prior, current and emergent role of targeted therapy in biliary cancers as
well as the ongoing investigational assessment of immunotherapy. Overall,
combination therapy is superior to single agent therapy in the first line
setting. For second line therapy, enrollment on to clinical trials is paramount
as no standard of care currently exists and no specific regimen has shown a
significant better outcome. Limitations of chemotherapy have been exposed and
future trials must have a logical design with incorporation of biomarkers that
can aid prognosis or predict benefit to therapy. Advances in genomic sequencing
can allow identification of potential actionable targets that can be exploited
therapeutically which is already underway with the targeting of FGFR2 fusions and
IDH1/2 mutations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC). With these approaches
there is potential to gain improvements in outcomes for patients affected by
these adverse group of cancers.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of resin-based yttrium-90 ((90)Y)
radioembolization for unresectable and failed first-line chemotherapy (cisplatin 
plus gemcitabine) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
METHODS: From February 2006 to September 2015, a retrospective study was
conducted of all patients who underwent resin-based (90)Y therapy for
unresectable and failed first-line chemotherapy ICC. Tumor response was assessed 
using modified RECIST criteria; side effects were assessed using Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03; survivals were calculated
from the date of diagnosis of ICC, beginning of first-line chemotherapy and first
(90)Y procedure, respectively; effects of factors on survival were analyzed by
Cox regression model.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (eight male and 16 female) were included in this
study. Mean 5.6 ± 1.6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy were performed prior to
(90)Y treatment. The mean delivered activity of (90)Y was 1.6 ± 0.4 GBq with a
total of 27 treatments. Disease control rate was 81.8% at 3 months after (90)Y
therapy, with partial response (n = 8, 36.4%), stable disease (n = 10, 45.5%) and
progressive disease (n = 6, 18.2%). CA199 changes pre- and 1 month post-treatment
were complete (n = 2), partial (n = 2), none (n = 5) and progression (n = 2),
respectively. Side effects included fatigue (n = 21, 87.5%), anorexia (n = 19,
79.2%), nausea (n = 15, 62.5%), abdominal pain (n = 10, 58.3%), vomiting (n = 4, 
16.7%) and fever (n = 3, 12.5%). Radiation-induced gastrointestinal ulcer was
identified in one patient. The mean follow-up was 11.3 ± 6.6 months, and the
median survivals from the time of diagnosis of ICC, beginning of first-line
chemotherapy and first (90)Y procedure were 24.0, 16.0 and 9.0 months,
respectively, and the 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-month survival after (90)Y therapy
were 69.9, 32.6, 27.2, 20.4 and 20.4%, respectively. ECOG performance status
(P = 0.002) and lymph node metastases (P = 0.019) had statistically significant
influence on overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Resin-based (90)Y radioembolization can provide palliative control
of unresectable and failed first-line chemotherapy ICC in a salvage setting with 
acceptable side effects.

OPINION STATEMENT: Biliary tract cancers are relatively uncommon, have an
aggressive disease course and a dismal clinical outcome. Until recently, there
have been very few clinical advances in the management of these patients and
gemcitabine-based chemotherapy has been the only widely accepted systemic
therapy. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies can potentially
change the treatment paradigm of this disease. Targeted therapy directed against 
actionable mutations and identification of molecular subsets with distinct
prognostic significance is now feasible in clinical practice. Mutation profiling 
has highlighted the genomic differences between the intra, extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. The mutational spectrum of
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma differs according to geographic location and
ethnicity. There is a higher incidence of chromatin modulating gene mutations in 
Western patients as compared with Asian patients with liver fluke-associated
cholangiocarcinoma. KRAS and p53 mutations are associated with an aggressive
disease prognosis while FGFR mutations may signify a relatively indolent disease 
course of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. FGFR and IDH mutations have promising 
agents in clinical trials at this time. An estimated 15 % of gallbladder cancers 
have Her2/neu amplification and can be targeted by trastuzumab. On the other
hand, an estimated 10-15 % of cholangiocarcinomas have DNA repair mutations and
may be candidates for immune therapies with checkpoint inhibitors. The promise of
targeted therapies for biliary tract cancers can be fulfilled with well-designed,
prospective, and multi-center clinical trials.

We report curative resection of an advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma that 
responded well to combined S-1 and gemcitabine chemotherapy(GS therapy). A
67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in July 2011 for upper right
abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with
abdominal para-aortic lymph node metastasis on the basis of the computed
tomography (CT) findings. She was treated with GS therapy. One course of S-1(80
mg/m(3)) consisted of the administration of the drug for 14 days, followed by 14 
days of rest; GEM(1,000 mg/m(3)) was administered on days 1 and 15 after
initiating S-1. After 2 courses of treatment, the sizes of the primary tumor and 
the lymph node metastasis were observed to be reduced on CT. In September,
partial hepatectomy and regional lymph node dissection were performed. The
patient subsequently received 22 postoperative courses of GS therapy. The
patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she remains free of recurrence
49 months since diagnosis. Therefore, GS therapy is a possible option for the
management of advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare malignant tumor. The 
etiology of ICC remains poorly understood. Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection has been implicated as a potential risk factor for ICC, particularly in
HBV-endemic areas. Elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is seen in
approximately 20 % of ICC patients. However, serum AFP levels higher than
10,000 ng/mL have only been reported in a few ICC patients. We report an unusual 
case of HBV-associated ICC occurring in a male with a markedly elevated serum
AFP.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old East Asian male presented with complaints of
epigastric distention and right shoulder pain. Laboratory tests showed HBV
infection, HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) slightly elevated (21 IU/mL) and serum
AFP markedly elevated (12,310 ng/mL). Computed tomography (CT) scan found a large
and irregular mass in the left lobe of the liver. The patient underwent the left 
hepatic lobe resection. Histopathological examination showed chronic hepatitis B 
in the background liver and the immunohistochemical (IHC) findings strongly
supported the diagnosis of ICC with aberrant expression of AFP. Serum AFP and HBV
DNA declined to normal level postoperatively. The patient received four cycles of
gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and took entecavir to prevent HBV reactivation. The 
patient kept disease free for 18 months in the latest follow-up.
CONCLUSION: ICC patients with HBV infection should be distinguished from other
ICC cases, based on distinct clinicopathological features and favorable outcome. 
Screening for HBV infection should be carried out before initiation of
chemotherapy. Antiviral therapy is indicated for prevention of HBV reactivation.

PURPOSE: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a fatal primary liver cancer
resulting from diagnosis at an advanced stage. Understanding the mechanisms of
drug resistance and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma may improve the disease
prognosis. Enhanced aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is suggested to be
associated with increased drug resistance and the metastasis. This study aims to 
investigate the roles of the ALDH isoforms in cholangiocarcinoma.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Aldefluor assays, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis were
used to identify the major ALDH isoforms contributing to Aldefluor activity in
human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. We manipulated isoform expression in HuCCT1 
cells to elucidate the role of ALDH1A3 in the malignant progression of these
cells. Finally, we used immunohistochemical staining to evaluate the clinical
significance of ALDH1A3 in 77 hepatectomized cholangiocarcinoma patients and an
additional 31 patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma who received
gemcitabine-based therapy.
RESULTS: ALDH(high) cholangiocarcinoma cells not only migrated faster but were
more resistant to gemcitabine. Among the 19 ALDH isoforms studied, ALDH1A3 was
found to be the main contributor to Aldefluor activity. In addition, we also
found that knockdown of ALDH1A3 expression in HuCCT1 cells markedly reduced not
only their sensitivity to gemcitabine, which might be attributed to a decreased
expression of ribonucleotide reductase M1, but also their migration. Most
importantly, this enzyme was also identified as an independent poor prognostic
factor for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, as well as a prognostic
biomarker of gemcitabine-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: ALDH1A3 plays an important role in enhancing malignant behavior of
cholangiocarcinoma and serves as a new therapeutic target. Clin Cancer Res;

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are highly expressed in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and are associated with poor prognosis of these
patients. The aim of the present study was to explore the inhibitory effects of
HDAC inhibitors on ICC cells and identify effective and sensitive drugs for ICC. 
Effects of 34 HDAC inhibitors were screened through two rounds of cell viability 
assays, and HC toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide first isolated from the secondary
metabolite of Helminthosporium carbonum, exhibited an antitumor activity superior
to that of the other HDAC inhibitors and gemcitabine. The mechanisms involved in 
the inhibitory effects of HC toxin on CCLP-1 cells were investigated by cell
counting, colony formation assay, cell morphological observation, real-time PCR, 
western blotting and flow cytometry. It was demonstrated that HC toxin inhibited 
the cell proliferation and clone formation ability of the CCLP-1 cells. HC toxin 
increased the acetyl-histone H4 level and this was associated with the inhibitory
effect of HC toxin on the CCLP-1 cells. We also found that HC toxin reduced the
level of HDAC1 protein in a post-transcriptional manner. Morphological
observation showed multiple morphological changes and indicated the possibility
of cell differentiation owing to HC toxin. With increasing concentration of HC
toxin, the cell cycle was gradually arrested at the G0/G1 stage and the
percentage of apoptotic cells increased which was not mainly through the
caspase-3-dependent ways. These results indicated that HC toxin was the most
effective among the various HDAC inhibitors with multiple functions in the
suppression of ICC in vitro. Thus, HC may be a potential chemotherapeutic for
ICC.

It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between metastatic and primary liver
tumors, when the liver tumor occurs simultaneously with a gastric cancer. We
encountered a case of resected gastric cancer, which occurred concomitantly with 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma after S-1 plus cisplatin chemotherapy, in a
patient who was previously diagnosed with metastatic liver tumor before
treatment. An 80-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of
epigastralgia. Endoscopic study of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed a type
3 tumor at the upper body of the stomach. A plain CT scan showed an irregular,
low-density area, which was enhanced by contrast medium in the lateral segment of
the liver. We performed an ultrasound- guided needle biopsy, because it was
impossible to make a definitive diagnosis by dynamic CT, contrast-enhanced
ultrasonography, and MRI. Immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin 7/20
resulted in 7 (+)/20 (-) for both the gastric cancer and the liver tumor.
Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with gastric cancer, which occurred
concomitantly with the metastatic liver tumor, and administered chemotherapy with
S-1 plus cisplatin. After 3 courses of the regimen, a reduction in the size of
mass was observed in the stomach and the liver. We subsequently performed left
hepatectomy and total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection. Microscopic
examination revealed the gastric cancer, which occurred simultaneously with the
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the
patient remains well without recurrences.

BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) patients who have undergone surgical
resection with major hepatectomy cannot tolerate the standard gemcitabine regimen
(1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) due to severe toxicities such as
myelosuppression. Our dose-finding study of adjuvant gemcitabine therapy for
biliary tract cancer following major hepatectomy determined that the recommended 
dose is 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. Here, we evaluate the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gemcitabine in these subjects.
METHODS: We evaluated BTC patients scheduled to undergo surgical resection with
major hepatectomy followed by gemcitabine therapy. A pharmacokinetic evaluation
of gemcitabine and its main metabolite, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), was
conducted at the initial administration of gemcitabine, which was given by
intravenous infusion over 30 min at a dose of 800-1,000 mg/m2. Physical
examination and adverse events were monitored for 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled from August 2011 to January 2013, with
12 ultimately completing the pharmacokinetic study. Eight patients had hilar
cholangiocarcinoma, three had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and one had
superficial spreading type cholangiocarcinoma. The median interval from surgery
to first administration of gemcitabine was 65.5 days (range, 43-83 days). We
observed the following toxicities: neutropenia (n = 11, 91.7%), leukopenia (n =
10, 83.3%), thrombocytopenia (n = 6, 50.0%), and infection (n = 5, 41.7%). Grade 
3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 25% (n = 3) of patients. There were
differences in clearance of gemcitabine and dFdU between our subjects and the
subjects who had not undergone hepatectomy.
CONCLUSION: Major hepatectomy did not affect the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine 
or dFdU.

Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is an uncommon and highly fatal malignancy. It is
composed of three main different entities; Gall bladder carcinoma (GBC),
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCC)
sharing different genetic, risk factors and clinical presentation.
Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance
cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) are the more important diagnostic techniques.
Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy but disease recurrence is
frequent. Treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both has not demonstrated 
survival benefit in the adjuvant setting. Cisplatin plus gemcitabine constitutes 
the gold standard in metastatic disease. New ongoing studies mainly in the
adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting along with molecular research will hopefully
help to improve survival and quality of life of this disease.

We investigated the sensitivity of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCA)
subtypes to chemotherapeutics and molecular targeted agents. Primary cultures of 
mucin- and mixed-IHCCA were prepared from surgical specimens (N. 18 IHCCA
patients) and evaluated for cell proliferation (MTS assay) and apoptosis (Caspase
3) after incubation (72 hours) with increasing concentrations of different drugs.
In vivo, subcutaneous human tumor xenografts were evaluated. Primary cultures of 
mucin- and mixed-IHCCA were characterized by a different pattern of expression of
cancer stem cell markers, and by a different drug sensitivity. Gemcitabine and
the Gemcitabine-Cisplatin combination were more active in inhibiting cell
proliferation in mixed-IHCCA while Cisplatin or Abraxane were more effective
against mucin-IHCCA, where Abraxane also enhances apoptosis. 5-Fluoracil showed a
slight inhibitory effect on cell proliferation that was more significant in
mixed- than mucin-IHCCA primary cultures and, induced apoptosis only in
mucin-IHCCA. Among Hg inhibitors, LY2940680 and Vismodegib showed slight effects 
on proliferation of both IHCCA subtypes. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Imatinib
Mesylate and Sorafenib showed significant inhibitory effects on proliferation of 
both mucin- and mixed-IHCCA. The MEK 1/2 inhibitor, Selumetinib, inhibited
proliferation of only mucin-IHCCA while the aminopeptidase-N inhibitor, Bestatin 
was more active against mixed-IHCCA. The c-erbB2 blocking antibody was more
active against mixed-IHCCA while, the Wnt inhibitor, LGK974, similarly inhibited 
proliferation of mucin- and mixed-IHCCA. Either mucin- or mixed-IHCCA showed high
sensitivity to nanomolar concentrations of the dual PI3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor,
NVP-BEZ235. In vivo, in subcutaneous xenografts, either NVP-BEZ235 or Abraxane,
blocked tumor growth. In conclusion, mucin- and mixed-IHCCA are characterized by 
a different drug sensitivity. Cisplatin, Abraxane and the MEK 1/2 inhibitor,
Selumetinib were more active against mucin-IHCCA while, Gemcitabine,
Gemcitabine-Cisplatin combination, the c-erbB2 blocking antibody and bestatin
worked better against mixed-IHCCA. Remarkably, we identified a dual
PI3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor that both in vitro and in vivo, exerts dramatic
antiproliferative effects against both mucin- and mixed-IHCCA.

BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare and lethal disease with few
therapeutic options. Preclinical data suggest that the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) pathway could be involved in its progression.
METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial recruited chemotherapy-naive
patients with advanced BTC displaying a wild-type (WT) KRAS status. Patients were
randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) ) with
(arm A) or without (arm B) panitumumab (6 mg/kg) for up to 12 cycles. The primary
endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) analyzed in an intention-to-treat
fashion.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (45 in arm A and 44 in arm B) were enrolled between
June 2010 and September 2013. After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the median
PFS was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3.3-7.2 months) in arm A and 4.4
months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.2 months) in arm B (P = .27). No survival 
differences were observed: the median overall survival was 9.9 months in arm A
and 10.2 months in arm B (P = .42). In a subgroup analysis, no differences in PFS
according to the site of the primary tumor were observed; patients with
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with panitumumab may have had a survival 
benefit in comparison with the control group (15.1 vs 11.8 months, P = .13). As
for safety, skin toxicity was the main adverse event in arm A (80% of the
patients). A higher incidence of diarrhea (55.5% vs 31.8%), mucositis (22.2% vs
13.6%), and constipation (24.4% vs 15.9%) was seen in arm A.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the marginal role of anti-EGFR therapy even
for WT KRAS-selected BTC.

The standard chemotherapy for the treatment of unresectable advanced and
recurrent biliary tract cancers is considered gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) on 
the basis of favorable results reported in the ABC-02 study from the UK and the
BT22 study from Japan. However, the GC cohort of the BT22 study consisted of only
42 patients, and we considered it necessary to confirm the effectiveness and
safety of GC chemotherapy in a multicenter prospective observational study in
Fukuoka. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in this study, including two
patients with recurrent disease. The median patient age was 67.5 years (range,
43-84 years). Twelve patients had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 13 patients
had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 12 patients had gallbladder cancer. The 
median survival time (MST) was 14.9 months, the 1-year survival rate was 54.5%,
and the median progression free survival (PFS) was 7.7 months. No
chemotherapy-related deaths occurred, and Grade 3/4 adverse events were mainly
hematological events including leucopenia in 13 (35.1%) patients and neutropenia 
in 12 (32.4%). The MST, 1-year survival rate, median PFS, and rate of Grade 3/4
adverse events in our study were similar to those of the BT22 study. In
conclusion, this multicenter prospective observational study confirms the
effectiveness and safety of GC chemotherapy for the treatment of unresectable
advanced and recurrent biliary tract cancers.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy regimens for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and
gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GC) remain interchangeable; however, response rates
are frequently suboptimal. Biomarkers from ICC and GC patients were interrogated 
to identify actionable differences with potential therapeutic implications.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, pathological specimens from 217 ICC and 28 GC
patients referred to Caris Life Sciences were evaluated. Specific testing by
immunohistochemical analysis for 17 different biomarkers was performed.
RESULTS: In the collective cohort (n = 245), actionable targets included: 95% low
thymidylate synthase (TS), 82% low ribonucleotide reductase subunit M (RMM) 1 and
74% low excision repair cross complementation group (ERCC) 1, indicating
potential susceptibility to fluoropyrimidines/capecitabine, gemcitabine and
platinum agents, respectively. Additional targets included TOPO1 (53.3% high,
Irinotecan), MGMT (50.3% low, temozolomide), TOP2A (33% high, anthracyclines) and
PGP (30.1% low, taxanes). Subgroup analysis by tumour origin demonstrated a
differential biomarker expression pattern with a higher frequency of ICC tumours 
showing low levels of TS (99% versus 72%, P < 0.01), and RRM1 (85% versus 64%, P 
= 0.02) when compared with GC. Conversely a greater frequency of GC demonstrated 
high levels of TOPO1 (76% versus 50%, P = 0.02) versus ICC, indicating a
potential increased benefit from irinotecan.
DISCUSSION: Differences in the molecular profiles between ICC and GC provide
evidence that the two are distinct diseases, requiring different treatment
strategies to optimize a response.

An American Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA)-sponsored consensus
meeting of expert panellists met on 15 January 2014 to review current evidence on
the management of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in order to establish
practice guidelines and to agree on consensus statements. The treatment of ICC
requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to optimize survival. Biopsy
is not necessary if the surgeon suspects ICC and is planning curative resection, 
although biopsy should be obtained before systemic or locoregional therapies are 
initiated. Assessment of resectability is best accomplished using cross-sectional
imaging [computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], but the
role of positron emission tomography (PET) is unclear. Resectability in ICC is
defined by the ability to completely remove the disease while leaving an adequate
liver remnant. Extrahepatic disease, multiple bilobar or multicentric tumours,
and lymph node metastases beyond the primary echelon are contraindications to
resection. Regional lymphadenectomy should be considered a standard part of
surgical therapy. In patients with high-risk features, the routine use of
diagnostic laparoscopy is recommended. The preoperative diagnosis of combined
hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) by imaging studies is
extremely difficult. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, but
survival is worse than in HCC alone. There are no adequately powered, randomized 
Phase III trials that can provide definitive recommendations for adjuvant therapy
for ICC. Patients with high-risk features (lymphovascular invasion,
multicentricity or satellitosis, large tumours) should be encouraged to enrol in 
clinical trials and to consider adjuvant therapy. Cisplatin plus gemcitabine
represents the standard-of-care, front-line systemic therapy for metastatic ICC. 
Genomic analyses of biliary cancers support the development of targeted
therapeutic interventions.

Advanced cholangiocarcinoma is associated with poor prognostic survival and has
limited therapeutic options available at present. The importance of angiogenesis 
and expression of pro-angiogenic factors in intrahepatic forms of
cholangiocarcinoma suggest that therapies targeting angiogenesis might be useful 
for the treatment of this disease. Here we report three cases of patients with
advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progressive after standard chemotherapy 
and treated with sunitinib 50 mg/d in 6-wk cycles of 4 wk on treatment followed
by 2 wk off treatment (Schedule 4/2). In all three patients, sunitinib treatment 
was associated with a sustained disease control superior to 4 mo, patients
achieving either a partial response or stable disease. A reduction in tumor size 
and density was observed in all cases, suggesting tumor necrosis as a result of
sunitinib treatment in these patients. In addition, sunitinib was generally well 
tolerated and the occurrence of side effects was managed with standard medical
interventions, as required. Our results suggest that sunitinib therapy may be
associated with favorable outcomes and tolerability in patients with advanced
cholangiocarcinoma. Those observations contributed to launch a prospective phase 
II multicenter trial investigating sunitinib in advanced intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (SUN-CK study; NCT01718327).

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the most common biliary tract malignancy. CCA is
classified as intrahepatic, perihilar or distal extrahepatic; the individual
subtypes differ in their biologic behavior, clinical presentation, and
management. Throughout the last decades, CCA incidence rates had significantly
increased. In addition to known established risk factors, novel possible risk
factors (i.e. obesity, hepatitis C virus) have been identified that are of high
importance in developed countries where CCA prevalence rates have been low. CCA
tends to develop on the background of inflammation and cholestasis. In recent
years, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cholangiocarcinogenesis
has increased, thereby, providing the basis for molecularly targeted therapies.
In its diagnostic evaluation, imaging techniques have improved, and the role of
complementary techniques has been defined. There is a need for improved CCA
biomarkers as currently used ones are suboptimal. Multiple staging systems have
been developed, but none of these is optimal. The prognosis of CCA is considered 
dismal. However, treatment options have improved throughout the last two decades 
for carefully selected subgroups of CCA patients. Perihilar CCA can now be
treated with orthotopic liver transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoradiation
achieving 5-year survival rates of 68%. Classically considered
chemotherapy-resistant, the ABC-02 trial has shown the therapeutic benefit of
combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. The benefits of adjuvant
treatments for resectable CCA, local ablative therapies and molecularly targeted 
therapies still need to be defined. In this article, we will provide the reader
with an overview over CCA, and discuss the latest developments and controversies.

A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed with liver dysfunction during a medical
examination. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple nodules
in the left lobe, anterior segment, andposterior segment of the liver, leading to
a diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Extended left lobectomy and
partial hepatectomy in the anterior and posterior segment with lymph node
dissection was performed. At the time of the operation, small nodules on the
peritoneum near the stomach were resected; these nodules were diagnosed as
peritoneal disseminations of ICC. The histopathological diagnosis was moderately 
differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (T4N0M1, Stage IVB). Adjuvant chemotherapy 
with S-1 was administered for 18 months. Thirty months after the operation,
multiple lung metastases were detected by using CT, and chemotherapy with
gemcitabine was initiated. Thirty-six months after chemotherapy with gemcitabine,
the patient is alive and at home despite her lung metastases, which grew slightly
in size. Herein, we report a long-term survival case of ICC with peritoneal
dissemination that was successfully treated with surgical resection and adjuvant 
chemotherapy.

We report a case of curatively resected intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
with hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV) reconstruction. A 25-year-old man
was diagnosed with ICC. Computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor had
invaded the left and common hepatic duct, the right and left HA, and the main
branch of the PV. Because the posterior HA was tumor free, we performed a left
trisegmentectomy, PV and HA resection and reconstruction, and a
hepatocholangiojejunostomy. Pathological examination revealed a tumor
classification of T3, N1, M0, Stage IVB. The patient was discharged on
postoperative day 59 and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m²) was administered as adjuvant
chemotherapy. However, abdominal CT revealed peritoneal metastasis 8 months after
the surgery. A gemcitabine, cisplatin, and TS-1 (GCS) regimen was selected as
treatment, and the patient is alive 13 months after surgery.

A 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of jaundice and general 
itching. Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated that the tumor was located in
the caudate lobe of the liver with hilar invasion and involved the hepatic
inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right renal artery and vein. The patient was
diagnosed with locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, for which she
underwent right hemihepatectomy with right caudate lobectomy, portal vein
resection, hepatic IVC resection, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and right
nephrectomy. IVC was reconstructed using vascular prosthesis by expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-ringed graft. The patient's postoperative course 
was uneventful. The patient was treated with gemcitabine for postoperative
chemotherapy, and 3 years after the operation, she died due to recurrence
resulting from peritoneal dissemination. Although the thrombosis-related vascular
prosthesis obstruction had occurred 2 years after the operation, no clinical
symptom were noted, such as lower leg edema or renal dysfunction, during the
postoperative course. Hepatic IVC prosthesis reconstruction for locally advanced 
cancer with extensive IVC invasion can be a useful surgical procedure for
improving the resection rate and maintaining quality of life (QOL) in such cases.

This case report describes an 83-year-old man with intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma who was referred by a local hospital. Abdominal computed
tomography (CT) showed a large tumor in hepatic segments 4, 5, and 8 involving
the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava, which is normally indicative of an
unresectable locally advanced tumor. After systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine
and cisplatin, the observed decrease in the level of tumor marker suggested that 
the cancer was responding to treatment, while radiological findings showed the
main tumor shrunk without the presence of distant metastases. Thus, hepatic left 
trisectionectomy with bile duct resection was performed after portal vein
embolization. Pathological examination revealed negative margins (R0). Eighteen
months after surgery, the patient is free of disease and shows no signs of
recurrence. An initially unresectable, locally advanced biliary tract cancer may 
be down sized by chemotherapy, which makes radical resection possible, at least
in a proportion of patients. This approach provides longer survival and may have 
a potential for disease eradication as a new multidisciplinary approach for
patients with unresectable locally advanced biliary tract cancer.

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab treatment
outcome as second-line treatment for metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients with metastatic intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma who were refractory to first-line therapy consisting of
gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy given intravenously
via intra-arterial infusion were treated with FOLFIRI [irinotecan (180 mg/m² i.v.
over 90 min) concurrently with folinic acid (400 mg/m² i.v. over 120 min)
followed by fluorouracil (400 mg/m² i.v. bolus) then fluorouracil 2400 mg/m²
intravenous infusion over 46 h] and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 wk. Tumor
response was evaluated by computed tomography scan every 4 cycles.
RESULTS: The best tumor responses using response evaluation criteria in solid
tumor criteria were: complete response for 1 patient, partial response for 4
patients, and stable disease for 6 patients after 6 mo of follow-up. The response
rate was 38.4% (95%CI: 12.5-89) and the disease control rate was 84.5% (95%CI:
42-100). Seven deaths occurred at the time of analysis, progression free survival
was 8 mo (95%CI: 7-16), and median overall survival was 20 mo (95%CI: 8-48). No
grade 4 toxic events were observed. Four grade 3 hematological toxicities and one
grade 3 digestive toxicity occurred. An adaptive reduction in chemotherapy dosage
was required in 2 patients due to hematological toxicity, and a delay in
chemotherapy cycles was required for 3 patients.
CONCLUSION: FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab combination treatment showed promising
efficacy and safety as second-line treatment for metastatic intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma after failure of the first-line treatment of gemcitabine plus 
oxaliplatin chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemoimmunotherapy has been used to treat intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However, little is known about the phenomena underlying
the immunomodulation of ICC cells elicited by chemoimmunotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary ICC cells from a patient with ICC who received
gemcitabine followed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), both combined with dendritic cells
pulsed with Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) peptides were cultured. ICC cells were treated
with gemcitabine, 5-FU or interferon (IFN)-γ in vitro. The phenotype of the ICC
cells was examined by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Stimulation of the ICC cells with gemcitabine resulted in up-regulation 
of WT1 mRNA, programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PDL1) and calreticulin.
Gemcitabine, 5-FU and IFN-γ induced up-regulation of mucin-1. Moreover, human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC, HLA-DR and PDL1 were extremely up-regulated by
IFN-γ.
CONCLUSION: Chemoimmunomodulating agents alter the immunogenicity of ICC cells,
resulting in complex clinical efficacy results.

Biliary tract cancer is a heterogenous group. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin has been
the standard chemotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer, but there is lack of
evidence on treatment in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC). We 
analyzed 29 patients with only IHC who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin
between June 2010 and February 2013. The median age was 63 years (range, 40-78
years), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of all patients
was <2. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival (OS)
were 4.3 and 7.3 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that platelet
count (≤180 × 10 per liter), metastatic site of more than 2, and albumin level
(≤3.5 g/dL) were independent prognostic factors for decreased OS. OS was
estimated based on the number of adverse prognostic factors: zero or 1 (good
prognostic group), 2 (intermediate group), or 3 (poor prognostic group). The
median OS for good (n = 15), intermediate (n = 10), and poor (n = 4) prognostic
group was 10.5, 6.1, and 1.6 months, respectively (P < 0.005). Relatively better 
prognosis of the good prognosis group comparing to other prognosis groups can be 
expected from the prognostic model established in this study by analyzing
patients with IHC treated with gemcitabine.

Therapeutic intervention in neddylation pathway is an emerging area for cancer
treatment. Herein, we evaluated the clinical relevance and therapeutic potential 
of targeting this pathway in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
Immunohistochemistry of neddylation pathway components in a cohort of 322 cases
showed that E1 (NAE1 and UBA3) and E2 (UBC12) enzymes, as well as global NEDD8
conjugation, were upregulated in over 2/3 of human ICC. Notably, NAE1 was
identified as an independent prognosticator for postoperative recurrence
(P=0.009) and a combination of NEDD8 and NAE1 provided a better power for
predicting patient clinical outcomes. In vitro treatment with MLN4924, a
small-molecule NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor, led to a dose-dependent
decrease of viability in both established and primary cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines. Additionally, MLN4924 exhibited at least additive effect when combined
with cisplatin. By blocking cullins neddylation, MLN4924 inactivated Cullin-Ring 
ligase (CRL) and caused the accumulation of CRL substrates that triggered cell
cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. Meanwhile, MLN4924 was well-tolerated and 
significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft model of cholangiocarcinoma.
Taken together, our findings indicated that upregulated neddylation pathway was
involved in ICC progression and interference in this pathway could be a promising
target for ICC therapy.

PURPOSE: We performed a phase I trial to investigate the safety, clinical
responses, and Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1)-specific immune responses following treatment
with dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with a mixture of three types of WT1 peptides,
including both MHC class I and II-restricted epitopes, in combination with
chemotherapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ten stage IV patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDA) and 1 patient with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) who were
HLA-positive for A*02:01, A*02:06, A*24:02, DRB1*04:05, DRB1*08:03, DRB1*15:01,
DRB1*15:02, DPB1*05:01, or DPB1*09:01 were enrolled. The patients received one
course of gemcitabine followed by biweekly intradermal vaccinations with mature
DCs pulsed with MHC class I (DC/WT1-I; 2 PDA and 1 ICC), II (DC/WT1-II; 1 PDA),
or I/II-restricted WT1 peptides (DC/WT1-I/II; 7 PDA), and gemcitabine.
RESULTS: The combination therapy was well tolerated. WT1-specific IFNγ-producing 
CD4(+) T cells were significantly increased following treatment with DC/WT1-I/II.
WT1 peptide-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was detected in 4 of the
7 patients with PDA vaccinated with DC/WT1-I/II and in 0 of the 3 patients with
PDA vaccinated with DC/WT1-I or DC/WT1-II. The WT1-specific DTH-positive patients
showed significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS) compared with the negative control patients. In particular, all 3 patients 
with PDA with strong DTH reactions had a median OS of 717 days.
CONCLUSIONS: The activation of WT1-specific immune responses by DC/WT1-I/II
combined with chemotherapy may be associated with disease stability in advanced
pancreatic cancer.

Systemic gemcitabine combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with
cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and isovorin for the treatment of advanced
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a pilot study.

Ishikawa T, Takami T, Segawa M, Yamaguchi Y, Uchida K, Terai S, Sakaida I.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a poor prognosis and
usually presents as advanced disease. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy
(HAIC) is a promising option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma; however,
there have been few reports on the use of HAIC in patients with ICC. In the
present study, we investigated the efficacy of treatment with systemic
gemcitabine (GEM) combined with HAIC with cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), and isovorin in patients with advanced ICC.
METHODOLOGY: Seven patients with advanced ICC, who received systemic GEM combined
with HAIC with CDDP, 5-FU, and isovorin were studied.
RESULTS: The response rate after the first chemotherapy cycle was 57.1% (partial 
response, 4; stable disease, 2; progressive disease, 1). The cumulative survival 
rates at 1 and 2 years were 85.7% and 28.6%, respectively, and the median
survival time was 22.3 months. With regard to grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions, the
percentages of patients developing leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
anemia, and anorexia were 28.6%, 28.6%, 42.9%, 14.3%, and 14.3%, respectively. Na
treatment-related deaths were encountered.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a pilot study, we suggest that systemic GEM
combined with HAIC with CDDP, 5-FU, and isovorin, may be a useful therapy for
patients with advanced ICC.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability
of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin as second-line
treatment for unresectable locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 12 consecutive
patients with unresectable locally advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
treated with HAI of gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) over 30 min) followed by
oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) over 2 h), which was repeated every 2 weeks.
RESULTS: All patients presented with disease limited to the liver and all had
failed at least one line of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. The
best tumor responses using RECIST criteria were partial responses in 8 patients
and stable disease in 3 patients for at least 3 months; in 1 patient, disease
progressed, resulting in a disease control rate of 91% (95% CI 45-100%). The
median overall survival and time to progression were 9.1 months (95% CI 4.9-8.1) 
and 20.3 months (95% CI 13.2-49.7), respectively. Partial responses enabled R0
liver surgery in 2 patients and stereotactic radiation therapy in 3 patients.
Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia in 2 patients, thrombocytopenia in 2
patients, and oxaliplatin allergy in 2 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: HAI combining gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed promising efficacy 
and safety as second-line treatment for locally advanced intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma.

We report the case of a 57-year-old man who was diagnosed with a large
unresectable cholangiocarcinoma associated with 2 satellite nodules and without
clear margins with the right hepatic vein. Despite 4 cycles of GEMOX (stopped due
to a hypertransaminasemia believed to be due to gemcitabine) and 4 cycles of
FOLFIRINOX, the tumor remained stable and continued to be considered
unresectable. Radioembolization (resin microspheres, SIRS-spheres) targeting the 
left liver (474 MBq) and segment IV (440 MBq) was performed. This injection was
very well tolerated, and 4 more cycles of FOLFIRINOX were given while waiting for
radioembolization efficacy. On computed tomography scan, a partial response was
observed; the tumor was far less hypervascularized, and a margin was observed
between the tumor and the right hepatic vein. A left hepatectomy enlarged to
segment VIII was performed. On pathological exam, most of the tumor was
acellular, with dense fibrosis around visible microspheres. Viable cells were
observed only at a distance from beads. Radioembolization can be useful in the
treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, allowing in some cases a secondary resection.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors
associated with gastric bleeding in patients treated with radiation therapy for
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 2002 and December 2008, 33 patients with 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were treated with radiation therapy to the
primary site. Twenty-nine (88%) patients were previously treated with
chemotherapy, including gemcitabine and cisplatin in 19 patients. The median dose
of radiation therapy was 50.4 Gy (range, 35-70 Gy). Twenty-seven (82%) patients
received concurrent therapy, with capecitabine in 26 and bevacizumab in 1
patient.
RESULTS: Nine of the 33 patients developed gastric bleeding, with a 1-year
actuarial rate of 36%. Of these 9 patients, 7 presented with bleeding symptoms
and 2 presented with anemia. All 9 patients were documented to have gastritis on 
endoscopy. The absolute and percent volumes of stomach receiving 40 and 50 Gy
were significantly associated with the risk of gastric bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have a significant
risk of developing gastric bleeding after radiation therapy. Hence, the volume of
stomach exposed to radiation therapy should be minimized in patients receiving
radiation therapy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare tumor, with an increasing
incidence worldwide and an overall poor prognosis. Symptoms are usually
nonspecific, contributing to an advanced tumor stage at diagnosis. The staging
system for ICC has recently been updated and is based on number of lesions,
vascular invasion, and lymph node involvement. Complete surgical resection to
negative margins remains the only potentially curable treatment for ICC.
Gemcitabine-based adjuvant therapy can be offered based on limited data from
patients with unresectable ICC. Overall 5-year survivals after resection range
from 17% to 44%, with median survivals of 19 to 43 months.

A 48-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of a liver
tumor (diameter, 10 cm), which was detected by abdominal contrast-enhanced
computed tomography. The tumor occupied mainly the left medial segment and
caudate lobe, invaded the left and right hepatic arteries, and obstructed the
left portal vein. The tumor was diagnosed as an unresectable intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, and chemotherapy (a combination of gemcitabine and S-1) was
initiated. Because the tumor continued to grow despite the chemotherapy, we
performed transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)as a second-line treatment, which 
successfully reduced tumor size to 7 cm. Thereafter, surgical resection was
performed. Histopathological examination indicated the presence of intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, which formed the main component, combined with hepatocellular
carcinoma. This tumor was diagnosed as a combined hepatocellular and
cholangiocarcinoma. Although adjuvant chemotherapy was not administered because
of prolonged pancytopenia, currently, at 5 years after the operation, the patient
is alive and has not experienced any recurrence.

BACKGROUND: A standard treatment for unresectable advanced-stage intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) has not yet been established. Although neoadjuvant
concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and liver transplantation are associated with
long-term survival in select patients, the outcomes of CCRT for advanced-stage
unresectable IHCC remain unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the
outcomes of CCRT in patients with unresectable advanced-stage IHCC.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with
unresectable advanced stage (stage IVa or IVb) IHCC who were pathologically
diagnosed and treated at National Cancer Center, Korea, from June 2001 to March
2012. Of the total of 92 patients, 25 (27.1%) received capecitabine plus
cisplatin (XP) chemotherapy with external radiotherapy (RT) (XP-CCRT group) and
67 (72.8%) received XP chemotherapy alone (XP group). The clinical
characteristics and outcomes of the 2 groups were compared.
RESULTS: The 92 patients comprised 72 male and 20 female patients, with a median 
age of 58 years (range 26-78 years). The baseline clinical characteristics of the
2 groups were similar. Patients in the XP-CCRT group received a mean 44.7 Gy of
RT and a mean 5.6 cycles of XP chemotherapy, whereas patients in the XP group
received a mean 4.0 cycles. The disease control rate was higher in the XP-CCRT
group than in the XP group, but the difference was not statistically significant 
(56.0% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.217). Although neutropenia was significantly more
frequent in the XP-CCRT than in the XP group (48% vs. 9%, p < 0.001), the rates
of other toxicities and > grade 3 toxicities did not differ. At a median
follow-up of 5.3 months, PFS (4.3 vs. 1.9 months, p = 0.001) and OS (9.3 vs.
6.2 months, p = 0.048) were significantly longer in the XP-CCRT than in the XP
group.
CONCLUSIONS: XP-CCRT was well tolerated and was associated with longer PFS and OS
than XP chemotherapy alone in patients with unresectable advanced IHCC.
Controlled randomized trials are required to determine whether XP-CCRT is a
primary treatment option for patients with unresectable advanced IHCC.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) is a standard chemotherapy
option for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). We compared the
efficacy and safety of capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) versus GP in advanced
BTC.
METHODS: The records of all patients treated with GP or XP chemotherapy for
unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent BTC at the National Cancer Center between 
December 2001 and August 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with
histologically confirmed intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, or 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were enrolled.
RESULTS: Of the 344 patients enrolled, 127 received GP and 217 received XP. At a 
median follow-up time of 8.9 months, the median time to progression was longer in
the GP group than in the XP group (5.6 vs. 4.7 months), but the difference was
not statistically significant (p = 0.081). The median overall survival (OS) was
8.4 months (95% CI 6.2-10.7) in the GP group and 7.6 months (95% CI 6.8-8.7) in
the XP group (p = 0.024), with statistical significance retained following
multivariate analysis (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.527-0.987; p = 0.004). Grade 3/4
toxicities were significantly more frequent in the GP group than in the XP group 
(40.9 vs. 24.9%, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: GP was superior to XP in prolonging OS, despite increasing the rate 
of grade 3/4 adverse events.

Bile acid accumulation in liver with cholangiolar neoplastic lesions may occur
before cholestasis is clinically detected. Whether this favors intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma development has been investigated in this study. The E. coli
RecA gene promoter was cloned upstream from Luc2 to detect in vitro direct
genotoxic ability by activation of SOS genes. This assay demonstrated that bile
acids were not able to induce DNA damage. The genotoxic effect of the
DNA-damaging agent cisplatin was neither enhanced nor hindered by the hepatotoxic
and hepatoprotective glycochenodeoxycholic and glycoursodeoxycholic acids,
respectively. In contrast, thioacetamide metabolites, but not thioacetamide
itself, induced DNA damage. Thus, thioacetamide was used to induce liver cancer
in rats, which resulted in visible tumors after 30 weeks. The effect of bile acid
accumulation on initial carcinogenesis phase (8 weeks) was investigated in bile
duct ligated (BDL) animals. Serum bile acid measurement and determination of
liver-specific healthy and tumor markers revealed that early thioacetamide
treatment induced hypercholanemia together with upregulation of the tumor marker 
Neu in bile ducts, which were enhanced by BDL. Bile acid accumulation was
associated with increased expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and downregulation of 
farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Bile duct proliferation and apoptosis activation,
with inverse pattern (BDL > thioacetamide + BDL >> thioacetamide vs.
thioacetamide > thioacetamide + BDL > BDL), were observed. In conclusion,
intrahepatic accumulation of bile acids does not induce carcinogenesis directly
but facilitates a cocarcinogenic effect due to stimulation of bile duct
proliferation, enhanced inflammation, and reduction in FXR-dependent
chemoprotection.IMPLICATIONS: This study reveals that bile acids foster
cocarcinogenic events that impact cholangiocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Pure laparoscopic hemihepatectomy is still a challenging procedure.
However, it is a minimally invasive liver surgery that leads to rapid recovery.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has a poor prognosis, especially when it occurs
with lymph node metastasis. We recently had a patient who underwent a pure
laparoscopic right hepatectomy and lymph nodes dissection for a large
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the right liver by an anterior approach with
hanging maneuver.
METHODS: Because the tumor was 77 × 50 mm in diameter, mobilization was performed
after the devascularization of the right liver. After the division of the right
hepatic artery and the right portal vein, short hepatic veins were sealed and
divided with a bipolar vessel sealer from the anterior face of the vena cava,
followed by the placement of a tape between the liver and the vena cava for
hanging. By means of the hanging maneuver, parenchymal transection was performed 
with minimal blood loss, and the cut surface of the liver became plane.
RESULTS: The operation time was 357 min, and the blood loss was 66 ml. A right
hepatectomy and complete lymph node dissection adjacent to the hepatoduodenal
ligament were performed successfully with a purely laparoscopic procedure. The
postoperative hospital stay was 10 days. The final diagnosis of the intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma with distant lymph node metastasis in the hepatoduodenal
ligament was pT1N1M0 stage IIIb (International Union Against Cancer criteria).
CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic procedure enabled the patient to have an early
discharge and adjuvant chemotherapy of gemcitabine with S1 initiated immediately 
after discharge. We present a video of the described procedure.

After hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the
second most common primary hepatic malignancy. The etiology of ICC in most
patients is not known, but its incidence is on the rise worldwide. There are 3
morphologic subtypes of ICC that can be characterized on cross-sectional imaging,
mass forming, periductal infiltrating, and intraductal growth; and the
radiographic characteristics of ICC may vary based on the subtype. Complete
surgical resection remains the only potentially curative option for patients with
ICC. Routine lymphadenectomy at the time of surgical resection should be strongly
considered, because lymph node status provides important prognostic information. 
After surgery, the 5-year survival rate for ICC remains poor at only 25% to 35%
in most series. Although numerous clinical trials have been conducted using a
variety of chemotherapy regimens to treat ICC, systemic options for ICC remain
limited. Doublet gemcitabine and cisplatin therapy is currently considered the
standard-of-care first-line therapy for patients with advanced disease. Because
ICC is typically confined to the liver and systemic chemotherapy traditionally
has had only limited efficacy, there has been increasing interest in locoregional
therapy. Although locoregional therapy may include intra-arterial therapies,
stereotactic radiotherapy, hepatic artery pump therapy, or ablation, most data
are limited. The purpose of this article was to provide a multidisciplinary
appraisal of the current therapeutic approaches to ICC.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the only curative treatment of biliary tract
cancer (BTC). However, the prognosis of BTC remains unsatisfactory. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the benefits of adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy for
BTC.
METHODS: We performed a historical cohort study that involved 198 patients who
underwent R0 surgical resection. Patients who underwent major hepatectomy were
administered biweekly intravenous gemcitabine at a dose of 800 mg/m(2).
Otherwise, patients were administered intravenous gemcitabine at a dose of 1,000 
mg/m(2) in 3 weekly infusions, which were followed by a 1-week pause. The primary
outcome was overall survival. The hazard ratio (HR) of adjuvant chemotherapy was 
estimated by propensity score-stratified Cox regression that was adjusted for
confounders.
RESULTS: Forty patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The HR of adjuvant
chemotherapy was 0.47 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.95; P = 0.03].
Subgroup analysis showed that the survival benefits were possibly modified by
lymph node positivity (HR 0.19; 95 % CI 0.07-0.58; interaction, P = 0.22), stage 
III (HR 0.11; 95 % CI 0.02-0.50; interaction, P < 0.01), intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) (HR 0.09; 95 % CI 0.01-0.67; interaction, P = 0.05), and
poorly differentiated tumor (HR 0.16; 95 % CI 0.03-0.85; interaction, P = 0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy for BTC may be effective,
particularly for patients with stage III and ICC.

Complete surgical tumor resection (R0) for treatment of intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is potentially curative, but the prognosis remains
dismal due to frequent tumor recurrence and metastasis after surgery. Adjuvant
therapies may improve the outcome, but clinical studies for an adjuvant approach 
are difficult and time-consuming for rare tumor entities. Therefore, animal
models reflecting the clinical situation are urgently needed to investigate novel
adjuvant therapies. To establish a mouse model of resectable cholangiocarcinoma
including the most frequent genetic alterations of human ICC, we electroporated
Sleeping Beauty-based oncogenic transposon plasmids into the left liver lobe of
mice. KRas-activation in combination with p53-knockout in hepatocytes resulted in
formation of a single ICC nodule within 3-5 weeks. Lineage tracing analyses
confirmed the development of ICC by transdifferentiation of hepatocytes.
Histologic examination demonstrated that no extrahepatic metastases were
detectable during primary tumor progression. However, formation of tumor
satellites close to the primary tumor and vascular invasion were observed,
indicating early invasion into normal tissue adjacent to the tumor. After
R0-resection of the primary tumor, we were able to prolong median survival,
thereby observing tumor stage-dependent local recurrence, peritoneal
carcinomatosis, and lung metastasis. Adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy after
R0-resection significantly improved median survival of treated
animals.CONCLUSION: We have developed a murine model of single, R0-resectable ICC
with favorable characteristics for the study of recurrence patterns and
mechanisms of metastasis after resection. This model holds great promise for
preclinical evaluation of novel multimodal or adjuvant therapies to prevent
recurrence and metastasis after R0-resection.

Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant disease of the epithelial cells in the intra-
and extrahepatic bile ducts. It is the most frequent biliary malignancy. The lack
of effective medical treatment makes a radical surgical resection the only
therapeutic option. However, frequently Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
metastasize in lymphatic chains, including the hepatoduodenal ligament, and it
often invades adjacent organs or metastasizes to other visceral organs such as
the lungs, bones, adrenal glands, and brain and the prognosis remains poor. We
present a case of elderly patient with a severe and progressive pain due to a
pathologic fracture of humerus. The medical investigations revealed the presence 
of an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignancy with very poor 
prognosis. Genome-wide, high-throughput technologies have made major advances in 
understanding the molecular basis of this disease, although important mechanisms 
are still unclear. Recent data have revealed specific genetic mutations (for
example, KRAS, IDH1 and IDH2), epigenetic silencing, aberrant signaling pathway
activation (for example, interleukin (IL)-6/signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3), tyrosine kinase receptor-related pathways) and molecular
subclasses with unique alterations (for example, proliferation and inflammation
subclasses). In addition, some ICCs share common genomic traits with
hepatocellular carcinoma. All this information provides the basis to explore
novel targeted therapies. Currently, surgery at early stage is the only effective
therapy. At more advanced stages, chemotherapy regimens are emerging (that is,
cisplatin plus gemcitabine), along with molecular targeted agents tested in
several ongoing clinical trials. Nonetheless, a first-line conclusive treatment
remains an unmet need. Similarly, there are no studies assessing tumor response
related with genetic alterations. This review explores the recent advancements in
the knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying ICC and the future
prospects in terms of therapeutic strategies leading towards a more personalized 
treatment of this neoplasm.

The prognosis for patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC)
is extremely poor. Case 1 was a 65- year-old woman who had an ICC of 9 cm in
diameter (mass-forming type) in the right lobe with portal trunk invasion. She
was treated with hepatic arterial infusion
chemotherapy[cisplatin(CDDP)/5-fluorouracil(5-FU)/l-leucovorin(l-LV)] and
radiation therapy (total dose, 50 Gy). After 6 months, abdominal computed
tomography (CT) revealed that the tumor had regressed. She survived for 7 years
without recurrence of the ICC; subsequently, she died of peritoneal cancer. Case 
2 was a 59-year-old woman who had an ICC of 8 cm in diameter (mass-forming type) 
in the left lobe with lymph node metastasis in the hepatoduodenal ligament; the
right hepatic artery was involved by the metastatic lymph nodes. She was treated 
with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(CDDP/5-FU/l-LV) and radiation
therapy(total dose, 30 Gy). After 10 months, abdominal CT revealed that the tumor
had disappeared, but paraaortic and mediastinal lymph node metastases were
detected. She was therefore treated with systemic chemotherapy. Treatment with
systematic chemotherapy enabled her to survive for over 5 years with a good
performance status.
